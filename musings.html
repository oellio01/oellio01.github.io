        <h2>An Unessisary Risk</h2>
        <p>&emsp; Donald Trump is the next president of the United States of America. The next senate will have 52 republicans of 100. The House of Representatives will likely have 240 republicans of 435. The Supreme Court will soon be majority conservative. Republicans will likely occupy 34 of the 50 gubernatorial mansions. The GOP will control 67 of 98 state legislative chambers. 
            <br>
	&emsp; This country was founded on the idea of checks and balances within government. If the president was over reaching, the legislature and Supreme Court were there to hold the country in balance. The government is supposed to be a slow moving beast that shifts with the general consensus of the country. This system of checks and balances only works if different parties control the different forms of government. However, we now have a single party that represents at most half the country's civilians in control of every major form of government across this country. 
            <br>
	&emsp; How could this happen? Democrats do not vote often enough. Vote early, often, and at all levels of government. There is this prevailing trend where democrats do not show up during mid-term elections, yet show up in force during presidential elections. This trend is even more drastic when the presidential election is compared to state level elections. Democrats are risking so much by not making the effort to vote for all levels of government. By being under represented at the state level, they are putting even more pressure on themselves to perform well on the national level. By not showing up in numbers for the mid term elections democrats put themselves in a hole in the presidential years, because they are losing contestable seats in the house and senate. Thus when it comes to the presidential election, the democrats have everything riding on it. They have to perform well or else they will lose the presidency and not reverse the congressional seats they lost in the midterm elections, and find themselves in a position where representatives of their views are not present in an major political position at any level of government. 
            <br>
	&emsp; It makes no sense to be so highly leveraged during the presidential campaign. You can have a bad candidate who does not draw out voters like the party needs. Maybe a scandal hits just before the election and for that reason a lot of potential voters switch over to the GOP ticket. There are an innumerable number of events that could cause a poor performance in a single election. To put all your chips on performing well on that specific day every four years is pin headed. </p>

        <h2>The Call to Write</h2>
    <p>&emsp; I am growing up in a world that will be recorded. Every online action will be recorded, preserved, and may be resurfaced in the future. For me, this presidential election put a magnifying glass on this issue. All email correspondences, speeches, interviews, which either candidate participated in since the inception of the digital era were reexamined for instances of moral lapse. In many ways this was positive in that it brought to the nations attention the flaws of the candidates that we were being asked to vote for. However it also means that a candidate is always on the clock. For a future candidate of my generation, every action from birth will be examined. The candidate is not afforded a private life. The candidate is not afforded a period of time to grow and experiment with different ideas, because in the era of sound bites those ideas will not be put in context and the candidate will not have a fair opportunity to explain him or herself. 
        <br>
&emsp; The positive effects of this change are real. The negative effects just as much so. The change is here to stay, and we each must decide how we are going to proceed. In many ways the idea of staying silent and proceeding with our lives in a quite manor is increasingly attractive. However, for a thriving democracy, the citizens must be engaged, topics must be discussed, ideas dispersed, and for that to happen people must have the nerve to stand up and say what they believe. That is what I am hoping to do, here. To the best of my abilities I am going to lay out logical thoughts on various topics that I feel passionately about. At the moment I have no grandiose plans for high office, but nonetheless, if years from now you are reading these posts for the purpose of sullying my name, have empathy for a kid who is trying to move minds in a positive direction. Each piece is only a snapshot of my mind at the time. I try my best to have coherent, well thought out, compassionate pieces. However naturally I will be misguided at times in my beliefs, and I welcome an articulated argument in response. It is the only way towards enlightenment. </p>
