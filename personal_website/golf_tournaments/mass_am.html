    <h3>Round 1:
        <p>I was super excited to return to Taconic. I had played the course a bunch of times because Williams hosts a tournament there every fall that Tufts goes to. I travelled up a couple days early to play a rainy practice round and to stay with some family friends. I was feeling pretty good about my game, but found myself extrodinarilly nervous standing on the first tee. It was the most nervous start I had all summer. I chunked two chips from a few feet off the first green and bogeyed the easiest hole on the course. I was all over the place on the front nine, birdieing the second, sixth, and seventh, but bogeying the fifth, and chunking a couple bunker shots on my way to a double on nine. The back nine was idyllic, until 16. I was even on the day, but feeling a little nervy about my game with the hardest holes coming up. I hit a 4 iron approach from 190, uphill with wind in the face on 16 and blew it long right. Double. I fanned a hybrid way right of the green on 17 and made a fine bogey on the most rediculous of golf holes. On 18, I made sure not to go OB left by sailing 80 yards right of the center line. I punched out and chunked an approach to the front edge of the green. I proceeded to really finish off the collapse of a finish by three putting, and settling for +4, 75 on day 1. Historically the cut line is always around +6/+7, so I knew I had really blown my cushin on the last few holes.</p>

    <h3>Round 2:
        <p>I was a bit too nervous for my own good. After a pair of nervy pars on 1 and 2, I chunked my 4 iron on the 215 yard par 3, which led to a well deserved bogey. Though the round felt like it was slipping away from me, I kept everything together, and after a birdie on the driveable 6th, I was back to even. Things started to go south with a chunk from 100yds on the tricky 7th. That started a chain of poor shots that resulted in five bogeys in a six stretch period. Reduced to a spectator I finished the tournament admirably with birdies on 16 and 18 to finish at +4 73 for the round and 6th overall. The real fun of the round came from watching Brandon Gillis. Thinking he was in the lead, we came to the 16th tee, only to find that a kid in the group ahead was -5 on the day and was -4 for the tournament. Gillis standing at -2, responded with an eagle on the par 5 16th, a par on the 17th and a swinging 25 footer with 100+ people watching to birdie 18 and win the tournament by 1. </p>

    <h3>Course Notes:
        <ul>
            <li>1. As easy a starting hole as you will find. Bunker on the right starts at 205yds from green. I like a 250/260yd shot off the tee as it leaves you short of the bunkers but still with a shot in for the green in two. </li>
            <li>2. Bunker cannot be cleared and starts at 120yds from green. I think 3 wood makes most sense.</li>
            <li>3. Bunker on the left at 150yds out. Take driver right down the middle. Its aggressive but I think the proper play.</li>
            <li>4. 4 iron off the tee. </li>
            <li>6. Bomb driver over the trees on the left. Large false front, try and keep the spin down on your approach.</li>
            <li>7. If comfortable with a fade, the safe play is a fade around the trees. I on the other hand will likely go up the 13th fairway; cuts about 20yds off the hole as well. </li>
            <li>10. Skirt it around the overhanding tree and you will have a shot at this green in two. Two tierd green, very important to plan out your apporach depending on which level the pin is on.</li>
            <li>12. Nervy hole. Take hybrid off the tee to stay short of the fairway bunker. Counter intuitively, it is much better to miss the green on the left side. Above the green right is absolutely dead. Aim for the left center of green.</li>
            <li>16. Tough hole. The approach is steeply uphill, but because of the back to front slope of the green it is better to end up short of the pin.</li>
            <li>17. Hardest par 3 you will find. 220 with a green high on Shrooms. Over or to the right of the green is close to dead. Much better to miss short or left. I have never been in the bunker short left but it doesn't sound too bad either.</li>
            <li>18. Pretty much unreachable from the back teebox. Avoid the fairway bunker off the tee and it is a fairly standard three shot par 5. Approach to the green plays ~5yds shorter.</li>
        </ul>
