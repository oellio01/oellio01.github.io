    <h3>Qualifier:
        <p>I played in the Mass Four ball with Aaron a week earlier, but this was my first individual stroke play event of the year. During my internship I hadn't played much, so I was less than confident heading into this. I started with a bogey on the first, as I chunked my first approach shot. I followed that up with a pulled approach on the second, for another bogey. On the short par three third I aimed for the middle but pushed my 3/4 pitching wedge. It worked out perfectly, landing just past the pin and rolled back to five feet. A birdie there got me rolling, and I pared the next eight holes. I got back to even with a seven foot birdie putt on the short par 4 twelfth. At this point, things start to get interesting. It is a qualifier, where the qualifying score is usually 76 (+5). I miss clubbed off the tee on the 13th, found myself short of the elbow, had to punch out, and made bogey. Pared the 14th. Had a three-putt bogey on 15. Hit a five iron from 188yds on the par three 16th. Purred it over the green, and scrambled to make a bogey. At this point I am +3 with two to play. The last two holes run parallel to one another. The first is a 520yd par 5, which has a large swale from 120yds out to 20yds. The latter is the 445yd par 4 18th, it has a large bank on the left of the fairway which separates the fairway from the 17th, a large hazard just off the fairway on the right side, and has a gorge running in front of the green such that you have a slightly elevated approach shot. Back on the 17th, I had my worst swing of the day and yanked my drive 50yds left of my target line. The ball hit on the side of the bank, and fortunately bounced out of the fescue, across the fairway and just rolled into the rough on the far side of the 18th fairway. My yank happened to be a shortcut, and I found myself 230yds in on the par 5. I was pretty convinced I could reach the green, an easy hybrid, across the hazard on the 18th, and up and over the swale and bunker short of the green. Pops talked some sense into me, and convinced me to lay up at the 150yd marker back in the 17th fairway. A simple par ensued, and I walked to the 18th tee feeling comfortable. The WGA had placed the tees up 30yds on the 18th, which convinced me to hit 3 wood. The main danger was right, so appropriately I pulled my tee shot left into the fescue on the left bank. The ball was 186yds out, with a decent lie, with a wide gorge lying between it and the green. I had listened to Pops on the previous hole, so I decided to ignore him on this one. I went for the green. A hooked chunk ensued and my ball barely made it into the near side of the gorge. It was definitely in the hazard, but not completely unplayable. I was seriously debating hitting it as it lay, when Howie, the hero of the story, comes to inform us that because it is a hazard, we may take the drop on up on the top level of the gorge as long as it was no closer to the hole. We thought this a marvelous idea, and found a spot that was an equal 73yds away from the pin. Laying four after the drop, we thought I needed to get down in three to guarantee making the cut. I chunked one up to the front of the green, and proceeded to hit my first putt to four feet. I now had a four footer that I needed to make to qualify for the Westchester Am. I drained it. 76 (+5).</p>

    <h3>Round of 32:
        <p>I wanted to beat James Nicholas. Yale kid, member of Winged Foot and Westchester CC! I was dreaming of stomping this kid 4&3 or 5&4. My dad knew it was going to be a tough match, and wanted me to be mentally prepared for it. This was to be our first match play event, and we were pumped up. The match started in very shaky fashion, pushing my approach shot to the first green onto the rocks bordering the water right of the green. I tried putting it off the rocks, but it wasn’t happening and I lost the first hole. I stuck a four iron on the 2nd to 10 feet and won the hole with a par. For the next many holes I pared him to death. Walking to the 14th tee I found myself 2up. I yanked one left into the trees and got a fortuitous bounce back into the fairway 150yds out. I pared, and James missed his 10ft birdie putt. I hit the fairway on the 15th, but James yanked his left into the trees. While Pops and I were looking for his ball, James went to a rules official about my not immediately picking the ball up after a putt was given. He "graciously" came over and informed me that he might have to call a penalty on me. We both pared the 15th, and the rules official came up to inform us that what I had done was in fact not a penalty. If we wanted to win before, Pops and I now wanted to rip this kids head off. I made a sloping 12 footer for a par and a tie on the 16th to push James to the brink. He didn’t shrink from the moment. He stuck his tee shot on the par 3 17th to 4 feet, and I missed the green. I lost the hole, and waled to the 18th tee up one with one to play. James roped a driver down the middle, threading it between a high bank on the left and OB on the right. I took a safer tactic, and hit a 3/4 3 wood. Standing 145yds out in the middle of the fairway, with our hearts pumping, Pops and I tried to judge what shot to hit. The green was slightly up the hill and protected on all sides by bunkers. The pin was positioned a few feet over the front right bunker, at the bottom of a long slope. Pops and I misjudged the wind and my approach, although online, landed in the rough above the bunker, short of the green. James, from 50yds closer, put one past the pin at the top of the slope. At the green, I played first, chunking my chip up five feet short of the pin. Standing there waiting for James to play, Pops turned to me and said "I bet James will still be away after he putts." Sure enough he was right, James blew his putt 6 feet by, and proceeded to miss the comebacker. Won 2up. </p>

    <h3>Round of 16:
        <p>After the morning's drama, I walked into the second round relaxed and confident. I started better than before, as we tied the first hole with birdies. We then continued around the front nine, trading holes back and forth. The highlights of the nine were Drake Fettirer's eagle on 5, and birdie on 7. We made the turn with me one down. Drake lost his approach shot into the par 5 eleventh, and i birdied to draw level in the match. We continued level with pars through the 15th hole. 16 is an uphill then downhill 440 yard par 4. I drove it great on this hole all week, and striped one up the gap and just through the elbow. Drake sailed his drive way right and struggled to make a bogey. My approach, an 8 iron from 165, came to rest some 15ft from the hole. It was clear when I hit my first putt that a two putt would suffice. I made Bon Jovi proud, as my first putt left me close to 6ft left. I settled myself and drained the putt for birdie. A green in regulation on the par 3 17th put the pressure on him. Drake got tremendously unlikely, as his shot nestled up against the trunk of a tree off to the left of the green. Left without a stance to hit his second he gave two feeble swings at it before conceding the hole and the match. Won 2&1.</p>

    <h3>Quarterfinals:
        <p>I was excited at first at the prospect of facing an old guy. I loved hitting it longer than my opponent, and an old guy would likely be more wily than long. I did a little research into Michael Karger, and scared myself pretty good. Leaning of his exploits at a Mid-Amateur I showed up to the first tee on edge. From the start he could not have been nicer. Unfortunately for him this put me in a zone, compounded with his off round, I walked away with it. I won the first after his approach found the water right of the green. Then I put the match away with a birdie on 6, a birdie on 7, a birdie on 8, and a par on 9. It was the best nine of my life, and I was 4up. I kept the quality play going on the back nine with a par on 10, birdie on 11, par on 12, par on 13, and par on 14. He took it with such class that he might have been the true winner that day. Won 5&4. </p>

    <h3>Semifinals:
        <p>After getting in early from the morning match, I had close to 1.5 hours till the semifinals. I ate lunch, took a short nap, and watched my two potential opponents finish up their match. It was James McHugh vs. Josh Goldenberg. James was a friend of a fellow Willow Ridge caddie and I had played with him a few times. He was having a phenomenal summer, and I had no interest in facing him. Coming down 18, the match all square, James hits his approach to 12ft, and Josh responds with a ball in the back round facing of the left bunker. The match was all but over. Josh hacked it out to a similar distance to James. From up above it almost looked as if Josh was away. Nevertheless, James went first and just missed his birdie putt. Needing the downhill left to right breaking putt to extend the match, Josh poured it in the heart. He knew right away that he had made it, and reacted with a Tiger like celebration. On 1, the first playoff hole, James uncharacteristically pushed his approach into the pond, and the match was over. The semifinal matchup was set. </p>

    <h3>Course Notes: 
        <h4>Ardsley Country Club</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Seven iron straight ahead on this very strange opening hole.</li>
            <li>Second hole plays a bit downhill, take off ~10 yards.</li>
            <li>Take it up over the trees to the left fairway on the fourth.</li>
            <li>Take driver and bomb it up the left side, past the bunker, on the sixth.</li>
            <li>The eigth, so simple, yet impossible.</li>
            <li>The tenth is a difficult driving hole, if downwind take driver over the bunkers, otherwise layup short of them.</li>
            <li>Take less than driver on the very short par 5, eleventh.</li>
            <li>Four iron leaves you 115yds out and short of the pond on 15.</li>
            <li>Take 3 wood off 16. It seems wrong, but a well hit driver will put you through the fairway.</li>
            <li>3/4 three wood (~240) leaves you far down in the fat part of the fairway.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Knollwood Country Club</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Hybrid will hit the downslope and leave you a wedge in on the opening hole.</li>
            <li>The third is a phenomenal ~120yd par 3.</li>
            <li>It is dangerous, but try to keep it down the left side on the par 5 fifth, so you have an angle to reach the green in two.</li>
            <li>The seventh is tricky. Thread hybrid down the middle, and follow it up with a shot to the left side of the green.</li>
            <li>It's hard to keep it on the left side of the fairway, but it is a flat area to hit down to the tenth green.</li>
            <li>I love driver off the thirteenth, but the smart play is hybrid straight down the hill.</li>
            <li>As long as your bunker game is intact, go for the green on 14.</li>
            <li>Play down a club on the 16th.</li>
            <li>The last is one of the best finishing holes in the world. It takes an accurate driver and long iron to hit the green in regulation.</li>
        </ul>
