    <h1> Owen Firclough Elliott </h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2> Age: 21 </h2>
    <h2> Born: 1994 in New York, NY </h2>
    <p> I've grown up in NY my whole life. Had a big move when I was one; we moved from the 8th floor to the 7th. My mom's name is Pamela and my dad's is Mark. I have a sister named Rebecca, she's 24. In highschool I played soccer on a travel team, and played golf in the summer. I was into architecture so I took a gap year and worked for an archiectural firm, Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Matriculated to Tufts in 2013, and played soccer, squash and golf freshman year. Now I am solely a golfer, a compsci major, and full fledged nerd ;).</p>
