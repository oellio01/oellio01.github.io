    <h3>Round 1:
        <p>I played a practice round that monday after the rains came; it was definitely helpful, but the winds off the water dried out the course for the weekend so it played very different. Aaron was kind enough to come caddie for me in the first round and promised to come back for Round 2 if I was in the lead (What standards!). Navigation to the course was less than ideal. I thought I knew the way from doing the drive once before, so I kept telling Aaron to turn off google maps. We got on Rt. 3 and after 30 miles or so I was positive the turn was just up ahead on the right. Sure enough we drove 20 miles past exit 4 (PCC is a mile down on the right on exit 4). Aaron, unnessisarily, turned on navigation and took us back on the quickest path to the course. We arrived in plenty of time; I had time to go inside, take care of my pre round dutties, and walk to the first tee for tee off (~5 mins). Parred the first, birdied the second, and was off. Played an all around stellar round of golf. Finished with a nervous bogey on the last for a -1 68. It was a ball striking clinic, as I hit 14 greens, and had ~8 makable birdie putts which did not fall. The round put me second on the leaderboard, and well within the first round cut of 76. Rightfully taking most of the credit, Aaron knew he had to return for the second round, and worked hard to get the day off from work.  </p>

    <h3>Round 2:
        <p>I was a bit too nervous for my own good. After a pair of nervy pars on 1 and 2, I chunked my 4 iron on the 215 yard par 3, which led to a well deserved bogey. Though the round felt like it was slipping away from me, I kept everything together, and after a birdie on the driveable 6th, I was back to even. Things started to go south with a chunk from 100yds on the tricky 7th. That started a chain of poor shots that resulted in five bogeys in a six stretch period. Reduced to a spectator I finished the tournament admirably with birdies on 16 and 18 to finish at +4 73 for the round and 6th overall. The real fun of the round came from watching Brandon Gillis. Thinking he was in the lead, we came to the 16th tee, only to find that a kid in the group ahead was -5 on the day and was -4 for the tournament. Gillis standing at -2, responded with an eagle on the par 5 16th, a par on the 17th and a swinging 25 footer with 100+ people watching to birdie 18 and win the tournament by 1. </p>

    <h3>Course Notes:
        <ul>
            <li>As open a starting hole as you will find in golf.</li>
            <li>The bunkers on the third holes give the illusion that the green is much closer than it is.</li>
            <li>Right of the green on the fifth leads to a sure bogey, due to a severe bowl green.</li>
            <li>Go for the green on six.</li>
            <li>Impossible greens on seven and eight. Right half is better on seven. Must take spin off the approach to the eigth.</li>
            <li>Driving is of critical importance on 11 and 12.</li>
            <li>Wind is usually into on the 15th, but the trees make it difficult to tell.</li>
            <li>Hybrid off the tee on the 17th to the wide part of the fairway.</li>
            <li>Bomb Driver over the bunker on 18.</li>
        </ul>
