    <p>
        My reasons for the trip were a bit of a mystery even to myself. For a couple of months I had come up with various reasons to different friends, none of which felt particularly accurate. Part certainly came from being without a bed to call my own, having let my lease go at the end of August. I had the ambition of playing professional golf, if only for a few years, and this fall was to be my time to try and qualify for the tour. After a miserable summer of amateur golf tournaments though, it was utterly and completely clear that I was not ready. Such an attempt costs an entry fee of around $5,000 so nothing to take lightly if you are not feeling confident. Thus I found myself in September no longer living with my best pals from college, without much of an idea for what came next.
    <br><br>
        This was only a fraction of the reason though. A new lease starting in September is not hard to find in the city of Boston, and the ties to a great group of college friends and my girlfriend who also lived in Cambridge were strong incentives to stay. Instead the call to the road came mostly from desire rather than necessity. A New York City kid, schooled and living in Boston, I was decidedly unacquainted with much of the country. From a youth spent playing golf and soccer tournaments I knew the eastern seaboard from Maine to North Carolina, but had only jetted in and out of a scant number of other places around the country. This fed a sense of claustrophobia and restlessness that was certainly part of my reason.
    <br><br>
        Growing up in a family where my father often referenced his great journeys across the country and around the globe, and in a country where individualism and exploration are part of its ethos, such a trip felt like a requirement of a well lived life. Soon to be 25, I saw many a long path before me. Qualifying and playing golf into my year 30s. Starting a company and its many early years of hard toil. A serious relationship and eventually the time requirements of a family. All roads leading away from free time and the long one. Maybe premature but fleeting opportunities on the horizon and the sinking feeling of passing youth were strong factors in deciding to drive across the United States from Massachusetts to California and many places in between.
    <br><br>
        This is not an exhaustive list of my reasons. Many more which I have yet to suss out feel to be lurking in the recesses of my mind. I haven't tried too hard to figure them out though. The important thing was going.
    <br><br>
        And so I found myself sitting in front of my boss, in a newly renovated and still very sparsely decorated office, asking him what he thought about me working remotely. “My sister is in Houston. She is a reporter there. Growing up in New York, I have lived in Boston for six years now, with school and now Redline, and I am growing kind of tired of it.” “Six years, I’ve lived here for 43 years,” Mark interjected. “Hahaha, yeah i don't know, I just want a change out of the northeast...and I was thinking about joining her in Texas. What do you think about me moving to remote work?” This was more than an arms length from the truth, but I did not want to make it too complicated for him. My plan was to depart in early October, with stops in Buffalo, Cedar Rapids Iowa, Rapid City SD, Denver, Jackson Hole WY, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Houston, and New Orleans by Christmas. For the past couple years, rather than giving each other presents my family took a little trip. This year we were spending Christmas in New Orleans, which made it the logical time and place for the trip to end. Once January hit I planned on coming back east for a few weeks to visit the girlfriend and former housemates. Then heading back to Texas, possibly Hoston, for February, March, and April, to prepare for the upcoming golf season. Houston was definitely a stop on the trip and possibly my location in the spring, but I told my boss Houston because I wanted him to say yes, and working remotely from Texas sounded a lot better than working from the road on a 5,000 mile 3 month long road trip. From my perspective remote was remote, and as long as I was completing my work, it did not matter where I was located. I just needed my boss to say yes. I also thought there was little possibility that work would find out about the plan so I wasn't too concerned about telling a white lie.
    <br><br>
        For a pretty low key guy who gives his employees a long leash, Mark took a long while to consider this idea. For a two week period I came into work thinking I’d hear the decision. Mark would walk into my office, me thinking he would say “Owen, do you have a moment?” and sweep his hand in the direction of his office; instead he was there to ask how progress was going on one customer ticket or another. At this point, due to my own initial procrastination in asking and Mark taking longer than expected in answering, it was late August and my lease was up in a week and a half. I needed to know where I stood, so if I did not get approval, I could act quickly to find a lease starting in September.
    <br><br>
        I walked into his office in the late afternoon, after Mark was finished with his multiple morning calls, and after I had time to complete enough work so I could give a positive status update if I was asked. Knocking on the door, “Hey Mark, do you have a moment?” Assent given with a nod of the head. “Have you had a chance to review my request? My lease is coming up and I kinda need to know one way or the other.” “Yes, yes, Houston, that's okay. Performance must stay high. Working remotely there are fewer remedies if performance drops.” “Thank you very much Mark!! I do not see any reason why performance would drop.” The two senior engineers on my team also worked remotely so all questions I had during a day of work had to be asked across the company chat app, Slack, anyway. My excitement made me pop up out of my chair and shake his hand. I was going, going on the long one.

    <p>
        “Bad, bad, not good.”<br>
        “What?”<br>
        “My suit bag.”<br>
        “You left it?”<br>
        “Bad.” Shaking my head.<br>
        “You left it at my apartment?”<br>
        “Worse.”<br>
        “You left it with the roommates at 91?”<br>
        “Worse.”<br>
        “You left it at J and Travis’s?”<br>
        “Worse.” Bumping my head against the side of the car now.<br>
        “You left it on the street?”<br>
        “Indeed.”<br>
        “NOOOOOOO!”, Isabel let out sympathetically. “That's literally the worst-case scenario. My house or 91 and I coulda just sent it. What are you gonna do? The Dakotas and Jackson are gonna be cooold.” 
    <br><br>
        There followed a sizable pause to let the news sink into both of us. All of my jackets and warm weather clothes were MIA. Left on the stoop of a random house on Lee St. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Here we had just gotten out of the car in Buffalo, stop one of the trip, a cool fall evening bringing the bag’s absence to my eye as I opened the trunk. 
    </p>
    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>
    <p>
        It had been over a month since I had been approved to work remotely, and I had spent my time bumming around Boston. September is a glorious month in the bay state, so I hung around, staying at Isabel’s and on friends' couches. Wonderful  activities ensued; a weekend on the cape with my housemates, a weekend in Newport with Isabel, the wedding of a family friend in the Berkshires. It was a charmed month. Not having a place to stay made my departure feel imminent and thus activities and emotions were at heightened levels. 
    <br><br>
        It was a month of extra rounds and toasts; toasts to the end of the college lifestyle and the past two years together. Friends from college, we had made the conscious decision that we wanted to live together after graduation. We thought at no other time of life were we going to be able to live with 3 of our best friends. Although we had various ideal paths for ourselves we thought living together would be an experience we would rue missing. It was more than we could have hoped for. Trying to explain such friendships always comes up short and sounds all too clique, but we really were guys who cared about one another. Thus this month was more than me leaving; a couple of our other friends had left a few months before and one of my housemates Zach was thinking of moving to DC come January, so the post-grad era was ending. Our friendships were likely at their most intense. We did not want it to, but life was moving us on.

    <p>
        Finally, I had all my stuff packed and on the curb next to my car at 9:15 on Thursday morning. Isabel had taken two days off work, the first to head north to visit her mother for her 60th birthday, and the second for us to drive out to Buffalo. I planned on staying at the housemates Thursday night and picking Iz up wherever her sister dropped her off Friday morning. Thus my box of snacks, my two bags of clothes, my suit bag, my golf bag, my camping gear, my kettlebell, my toolbox, and an extra pillow were all strewn on the wetness beside Norman. With Norman, a little two-door Hyundai Accent Hatchback, packing had to be deliberate. Golf bag on the left side, clothes bags on the top of the folded down back seats, snacks and camping gear on the flat nearest the trunk door, and finally pillow and kettlebell wedged behind the passenger seat. 
    <br><br>
        “Big road trip?”<br>
        “Indeed, I am driving cross country to San Francisco.”<br>
        “Oh my. I did that once. Nebraska was sooo goddamn boring. Flat and endless. What route are you taking?”<br>
        “I-90! At least most of the way. Buffalo, Iowa, the Dakotas, Denver, Jackson Hole, San Fran!”<br>
        “A lotta driving. Best of luck. Have fun!”
    <br><br>
        My phone said 9:41, I was quite late for work. I’d need 29 minutes of speeding to make my morning meeting at 10:10. I jumped in the car and sped off, leaving my suit bag right there, on the 3ft tall rock ballast which marked the start of the stairs up to the yellow house, the first one on the right of Lee st.           
    </p>
    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>
    <p>
        At work, I was in serious shit. I’d gotten a bit confused about if Isabel and I were taking Friday off to drive to Buffalo early or if we were leaving after work on Friday. She had lived in Buffalo the year before and had been asking me to go for a while. This trip provided the perfect opportunity. Buffalo was on the direct route out, seven hours west on I-90 from Boston. We’d discussed driving after work on Friday but it meant the weekend activities would be very cramped. On the other hand, leaving early Friday would require taking a day off, a commodity that Isabel was running low on. Confused about our decision, I did not realize my error until after I had put in my request to take the following week off. I am not proud of it, but I felt weird about asking for another vacation day given how nice they had been in granting me remote work, and so I kept procrastinating. I finally came up with the plan that I would ask for the day off because the packing was going very badly. In their minds, I was packing up and would be taking the following week off to drive down to Texas, where I would set up shop for the foreseeable future. I would say packing was going so poorly that I thought I’d need to take Friday off in order to finish. 
    <br><br>
        But now I was late! It was 9:41 and I needed to ask this morning! I couldn't show up late to our already very leisurely 10:10 meeting and ask for the following day off! I sped. Through Cambridge, onto route 28, and up 1-93 to Woburn. I sprinted up the stairs, put my stuff down, composed myself, and walked into Mark’s office for our morning meeting. The plan was to ask at the end of the meeting when Mark would ask “Anybody have anything else?” With the wording and tone of my request running through my head on repeat, Mark mentioned that he would be out the next day and thus no meeting. I started to think, to conspire. Not proud, not proud, very very guilty. In my dread  I kept my mouth shut leaving the insidious plot of just not working on Friday. Without the morning meeting, nobody would check in on me, certainly not on a Friday. None of my work was time-critical and I would be able to make it up in the week I had actually taken off. And so I found myself picking up Isabel at 10:30 on a day when I was on the clock. Iz had made such a big deal about how hard it had been for her to take the day off that I had absolutely no courage to tell her about my mischievousness. 
    </p>
    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>
    <p>
        The timing for Iz could not have been worse work-wise. Having been put on three upcoming deals, she had worked 12 hour days Monday-Wednesday, only to have to work in the car on the drive out. Huddled over her computer on her vacation day, her focus was so intense that she could not hear the outside world. My questions were not heard much less responded to. After four hours of that, plus not being able to listen to any of my downloaded books because Iz also wanted to listen to them, I was drowsy, testy, and was not having fun. I needed a short snooze and Iz had a call so we switched seats and Iz would talk as she drove. 
    <br><br>
        Waking up quite dazed and groggy, I looked down to see the car keys in my lap, my phone 56 minutes advanced, and the car parked in a service area. Confused, I shuffled out of the car to go to the bathroom and find Iz. Not finding her inside the building or outside on the benches I was befuddled. I went back to the car to get my water bottle, locked the car with the driver’s side door button because the key fob seemed to have died, and returned to the building for a second search. I found her near an outlet, hidden by a massage chair, huddled over her computer, typing furiously. She had made it 35 minutes before pulling off and getting back online. 
    <br><br>
        Still drowsy but exasperated by our slow pace I said I would drive. Getting back in the car I pulled onto the highway and noticed there was definitely something wrong. There was a red light on the dashboard with the letters “tpms”, the clock was blank, the trip odometer had reset to 0, and the interior lights weren’t working either. Thinking back to the service area I wondered if these were related to the car keys not being able to lock or unlock the car remotely. Asking Iz if anything had happened while she was driving, I got no response. Not knowing what was wrong with my car, but knowing something was definitely up, on the opening leg of a 5,000-mile journey, in the presence of a mute companion, my voice cranked up to a volume and tone much too dramatic. 
    <br><br>
        Having decided to start dating a year before we were both immensely pleased with how it was going. And I do mean decided. With our fathers being best friends from college, and our families still close, we had discussions before making the plunge, not wanting to get wet if the relationship didn't have legs. Six months after giving it a shot we had looped the parents in on the situation, much to their audible chagrin. Both fathers were nonplussed, a reaction they have since declared untrue. Regardless, no damage was done. A year in and we were enjoying each other's company immensely. All of this to say, we wanted to have a good weekend. I wasn't sure where life would take me after this road trip, but I did not think a return to Boston was in the cards. Six years of living there, long winters, and a world of wonders, weighed against it. This might be our last weekend before a long-term long-distance relationship.
    <br><br>
        Isabel’s dismissive responses to my continued questions about if something had happened to the car, did nothing to dilute my tone or rising worry. Pulling over to the side of I-90 somewhere between Albany and Rochester on a sunny, blustery, fall day, the first car investigation of the trip ensued. The hood was raised, the manual brought out, and phones sent into action. Much to our novice delight, 10 minutes later we had the working theory that it was a blown fuse, one that controlled the interior lights, clock, odometer, and a couple of other things. The details in the manual and our observations matched up. Unable to get the broken fuse out of the power connector box, an item whose existence we had just learned of, we hopped back in the car and proceeded on our way, our worry eased that anything serious was actually wrong. 
    <br><br>
        Not yet well acquainted with the practice of arguing we laughed about how we had gotten a bit taken away. 
    </p>
    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>
    <p>
        Darkness descended right around the time when we were arriving at Niagara Falls. Isabel forgot to bring her passport so we were relegated to  the US side. All the pictures which pop into your mind when you think of the falls are from the Canadian side. The US side looks down from the top of the falls, whereas the Canadians have the full expanse of the falls, which makes for some great pictures. 
    <br><br>
        We found the US side absolutely exhilarating though. Isabel had been to the falls a few times but always from the Canadian side, and found the view down the falls, especially from Luna Island, heart pounding. The water crested over the edge and dashed down 150 feet onto massive boulders which had broken off the falls years before. Across the way, there were massive flood lights with rotating colors focused on the falls for the evening onlookers delight. The light interacting with the mist, just barely illuminating the drenched boulders below, was mesmerizing. Iz and I went back and forth trying to explain the scene. “It's apocalyptic!” “Looks like the coastline of Maine when a big storm is bearing down.” “These rocks are what specs of dirt would be in a human shower.” From stop to stop within Niagara State Park we would run, just too excited to be there and pumped up from the otherworldly scene below.

        From Niagara we headed to the consensus best buffalo wings in Buffalo and a quick tour around Isabel’s old neighborhood. Gabriel’s Gate, is an old-timey restaurant in a two story house, with wood paneling, wooden bench seating, and huge animal busts peering down at out from above the bar. Nothing fancy, just two dozen gloriously lathered wings with wooden discard bowls. Surrounding it is the neighborhood of Allentown, a combination of stately 1800’s mansions, leftover from the golden age of the Erie Canal, interspersed among empty lots, and spots of gentrification. Isabel pointed out some of her favorite haunts and told stories of this or that when somethings around us reminded her. A bit after 10pm we headed to the Airbnb and discovered the missing suit bag. 
    <br><br>
        Friends from Isabel’s old job joined by significant others and siblings had all rented a house in Ellicottville, a little way out of Buffalo, as our home base for Fall Fest, the biggest harvest festival in Western New York, and invited us to join for the weekend. The result was 16 people in an Airbnb with beds for 9 and two couches. Isabel and I were assigned to the top bunk of a twin bed bunk bed. It was to be a cozy final weekend together. 
    <br><br>
        Fall fest turned out to consist of a few stages for live music, 100 or so street fair vendors, an assortment of fried foods, and tons of people, all situated in a very picturesque town a bit outside of Buffalo. Two-story brick buildings with cute shops, the classic white steeple church, beautiful fall foliage, and lovely fall weather. Isabel’s friends were super nice, and we spent our days eating and drinking our way through town.
