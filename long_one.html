        <h1>The Long One</h1>
        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>
            My reasons for the trip were a bit of a mystery even to myself. For a couple of months I had come up with various reasons to different friends, none of which felt particularly accurate. Part certainly came from being without a bed to call my own, having let my lease go at the end of August. I had the ambition of playing professional golf, if only for a few years, and this fall was to be my time to try and qualify for the tour. After a miserable summer of amateur golf tournaments though, it was utterly and completely clear that I was not ready. Such an attempt costs an entry fee of around $5,000 so nothing to take lightly if you are not feeling confident. Thus I found myself in September no longer living with my best pals from college, without much of an idea for what came next.
        <br><br>
            This was only a fraction of the reason though. A new lease starting in September is not hard to find in the city of Boston, and the ties to a great group of college friends and my girlfriend who also lived in Cambridge were strong incentives to stay. Instead the call to the road came mostly from desire rather than necessity. A New York City kid, schooled and living in Boston, I was decidedly unacquainted with much of the country. From a youth spent playing golf and soccer tournaments I knew the eastern seaboard from Maine to North Carolina, but had only jetted in and out of a scant number of other places around the country. This fed a sense of claustrophobia and restlessness that was certainly part of my reason.
        <br><br>
            Growing up in a family where my father often referenced his great journeys across the country and around the globe, and in a country where individualism and exploration are part of its ethos, such a trip felt like a requirement of a well lived life. Soon to be 25, I saw many a long path before me. Qualifying and playing golf into my year 30s. Starting a company and its many early years of hard toil. A serious relationship and eventually the time requirements of a family. All roads leading away from free time and the long one. Maybe premature but fleeting opportunities on the horizon and the sinking feeling of passing youth were strong factors in deciding to drive across the United States from Massachusetts to California and many places in between. 
        <br><br>
            This is not an exhaustive list of my reasons. Many more which I have yet to suss out feel to be lurking in the recesses of my mind. I haven't tried too hard to figure them out though. The important thing was going. 
        <br><br>
            And so I found myself sitting in front of my boss, in a newly renovated and still very sparsely decorated office, asking him what he thought about me working remotely. “My sister is in Houston. She is a reporter there. Growing up in New York, I have lived in Boston for six years now, with school and now Redline, and I am growing kind of tired of it.” “Six years, I’ve lived here for 43 years,” Mark interjected. “Hahaha, yeah i don't know, I just want a change out of the northeast...and I was thinking about joining her in Texas. What do you think about me moving to remote work?” This was more than an arms length from the truth, but I did not want to make it too complicated for him. My plan was to depart in early October, with stops in Buffalo, Cedar Rapids Iowa, Rapid City SD, Denver, Jackson Hole WY, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Houston, and New Orleans by Christmas. For the past couple years, rather than giving each other presents my family took a little trip. This year we were spending Christmas in New Orleans, which made it the logical time and place for the trip to end. Once January hit I planned on coming back east for a few weeks to visit the girlfriend and former housemates. Then heading back to Texas, possibly Hoston, for February, March, and April, to prepare for the upcoming golf season. Houston was definitely a stop on the trip and possibly my location in the spring, but I told my boss Houston because I wanted him to say yes, and working remotely from Texas sounded a lot better than working from the road on a 5,000 mile 3 month long road trip. From my perspective remote was remote, and as long as I was completing my work, it did not matter where I was located. I just needed my boss to say yes. I also thought there was little possibility that work would find out about the plan so I wasn't too concerned about telling a white lie. 
        <br><br>
            For a pretty low key guy who gives his employees a long leash, Mark took a long while to consider this idea. For a two week period I came into work thinking I’d hear the decision. Mark would walk into my office, me thinking he would say “Owen, do you have a moment?” and sweep his hand in the direction of his office; instead he was there to ask how progress was going on one customer ticket or another. At this point, due to my own initial procrastination in asking and Mark taking longer than expected in answering, it was late August and my lease was up in a week and a half. I needed to know where I stood, so if I did not get approval, I could act quickly to find a lease starting in September. 
        <br><br>
            I walked into his office in the late afternoon, after Mark was finished with his multiple morning calls, and after I had time to complete enough work so I could give a positive status update if I was asked. Knocking on the door, “Hey Mark, do you have a moment?” Assent given with a nod of the head. “Have you had a chance to review my request? My lease is coming up and I kinda need to know one way or the other.” “Yes, yes, Houston, that's okay. Performance must stay high. Working remotely there are fewer remedies if performance drops.” “Thank you very much Mark!! I do not see any reason why performance would drop.” The two senior engineers on my team also worked remotely so all questions I had during a day of work had to be asked across the company chat app, Slack, anyway. My excitement made me pop up out of my chair and shake his hand. I was going, going on the long one.

            “Bad, bad, not good.”
            “What?”
            “My suit bag.”
            “You left it?”
            “Bad.” Shaking my head.
            “You left it at my apartment?”
            “Worse.”
            “You left it with the roommates at 91?”
            “Worse.”
            “You left it at J and Travis’s?”
            “Worse.” Bumping my head against the side of the car now.
            “You left it on the street?”
            “Indeed.”
            “NOOOOOOO!”, Isabel let out sympathetically. "That's literally worst case scenario. My house or 91 and I coulda just sent it. What are you gonna    do? The Dakotas and Jackson are gonna be cooold.” Thanks for that Isabel.
        <br><br>
            A sizable pause to let the news sink into both of us. 
        <br><br>
            All of my jackets and warm weather tops were MIA. Left on the stoop of a random house on Lee St. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This was the moment   I realized, getting out of my car in Buffalo, New York. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            It had been over a month since I had been granted approval to work remotely, and I had spent my time bumming around Boston. September is a glorious month in the bay state, so I hung around, staying at Isabel’s and on friends' couches. Wonderful weekend activities ensued; a weekend on the cape with my former housemates, a weekend in Newport with Isabel, a wedding in the Berkshires of a family friend. It was a charmed month. Not having a place to stay made departure feel imminent and thus activities and emotions were at heightened levels. 
        <br><br>
            It was a month of extra rounds and toasts, toasts to the end of the college lifestyle and the past two year together. Friends from college, we had made the conscious decision that we wanted to live together after graduation. We thought at no other time of life were we going to be able to live with 3 of our best friends. Although we had various ideal paths for ourselves we thought living together would be an experience we would rue missing. And it really was more than we could have hoped for. Trying to explain such friendships always comes up short and sound all too clique, but we really were guys who cared about one another. Thus this month was more than me leaving, with a couple of our other friends had left and one of my housemates Zach was thinking of moving to DC come January, the post grad era was ending, our friendships were likely at their most intense. We did not want it to but life was moving us on.  
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Finally I had all my stuff packed and on the curb next to my car at 9:15 on Thursday morning. Isabel had taken two days off work, the first to head north early Thursday morning go visit her mother for her 60th birthday, and the second for us to drive out to Buffalo. I planned on staying at the housemates Thursday night and picking Iz up wherever her sister dropped her off Friday morning. Thus my box of snacks, my two bags of clothes, my suit bag, my golf bag, my camping gear, my kettlebell, my toolbox, and an extra pillow were all strewn on the wetness beside Norman. With Norman, a little two door hyundai accent, packing had to be deliberate. Golf bag on the left side, clothes bags on the top of the folded down back row, snacks and camping gear on the flat nearest the trunk door, and finally pillow and kettlebell wedged behind the passenger seat. 
        <br><br>
            “Big road trip?”
            “Indeed, I am actually driving cross country to San Francisco.”
            “Oh my. I did that once. Nebraska was sooo goddamn boring. Flat and endless. What route are you taking?”
            “I-90! At least most of the way. Buffalo, Iowa, the Dakotas, Denver, Jackson Hole, San Fran!”
            “A lotta driving. Best of luck. Have fun!”
        <br><br>
            My phone said 9:41, I was quite late for work. I needed all 29 minutes with speeding to make my morning meeting at 10:10. I jumped in the car and sped off, leaving my suit bag right there, on the 3ft tall rock ballast which marked the start of the stairs up to the yellow house, the first one on the right of Lee st. 
        <br><br>
            At work I was in serious shit. I’d gotten a bit confused about if Isabel and I were taking Friday off to drive to Buffalo early or if we were leaving after work. She had lived in Buffalo the year before and had been asking me to go for a while. This trip provided the perfect opportunity. Buffalo was on the direct route out, 7 hours west on I-90 from Boston. We’d discussed driving after work on Friday but it meant the weekend activities would be very cramped. On the other hand leaving early friday would require taking a day off, a commodity which Isabel was running low on. Confused about our decision, I did not realize my error until after I had put in my time off request for the following week. I am not proud of it, but I felt weird about asking for another vacation day given how nice they had been in granting me remote work, and so I kept procrastinating. I finally came up with the plan that I would ask for the day off because packing was going very badly. In their minds I was packing up and would be taking the following week off to drive down to Texas, where I would set up shop for the foreseeable future. I would say packing was going so poorly that I thought I’d need to take Friday off in order to finish. 
        <br><br>
            But now I was late! It was 9:41 and I needed to ask this morning! I couldn't show up late to our already very leisurely 10:10 meeting and ask for the following day off! I sped. Through Cambridge, onto route 28, and up 1-93 to Woburn. I sprinted up the stairs, put my stuff down, composed myself, and walked into Mark’s office for our morning meeting. The plan was to ask at the end of the meeting when Mark would ask “Anybody have anything else?” With the wording and tone of my request running through my head on repeat, Mark mentioned that he would be out the next day and thus no meeting. I started to think, to conspire. Not proud, not proud, very very guilty. In my dread of asking I kept my mouth shut leaving the insidious plot of just not working on Friday as the plan. Without the morning meeting nobody would check in on me, certainly not on a Friday. None of my work was time critical and I would be able to make it up in the week I had actually taken off. 
        <br><br>
            And so I found myself picking up Isabel at 10:30 on a day when I was on the clock. Iz had made such a big deal about how hard it had been for her to take the day off that I had absolutely no courage to tell her about my mischievousness. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            The timing for Iz could not have been worse work wise. Having been put on three upcoming deals, she had worked 12 hours days Monday-Wednesday, only to have to work in the car on the drive out. Huddled over her computer on her vacation day, her focus was so intense that she could not hear the outside world. My questions were not heard much less responded to. After four hours of that, plus not being able to listen to any of my downloaded books because Iz also wanted to listen to them, I was drowsy, testy, and was not having fun. I needed a short snooze and Iz had a call so we switched seats and Iz would talk as she drove. 
        <br><br>
            Waking up quite dazed and groggy, I looked down to see the car keys in my lap, my phone saying that 56 minutes had passed, and the car was parked in a service area. Confused, I shuffled out of the car to go to the bathroom and find Iz. Not finding her inside the building or outside on the benches I was befuddled. I went back to the car to get my water bottle to fill up, locked the car with the driver side door button because the key fob seemed to have died, and returned to the building for a second search. I found her near an outlet, hidden by a massage chair, huddled over her computer typing furiously. She had made it 35 minutes before pulling off and getting back online. 
        <br><br>
            Still drowsy but exasperated by our slow pace I said I would drive. Getting back in the car I pulled onto the highway and noticed there was definitely something wrong. There was a red light on the dashboard with the letters “tpms”, the clock was blank, the trip odometer had reset to 0, and huh, the interior lights weren’t working either. Thinking back to the service area I wondered if these were related to the car keys not being able to lock or unlock the car remotely. Asking Iz if anything had happened while she was driving, I got no response. Not knowing what was wrong with my car, but knowing something was definitely up, on the opening leg of a 5,000 mile journey, brought my voice up to a volume and tone much too dramatic. 
        <br><br>
            Having decided to start dating a year before we were both immensely pleased with how it was going. And I do mean decided. Our fathers being best friends from college, and our families still being close, we had discussions before making the plunge. No getting wet if the relationship didn't have legs. Six months after giving it a shot we had looped the parents in on the situation, much to their audible chagrin. Both fathers were nonplussed, a reaction they have since declared as untrue. Regardless, no damage done. A year in and we were enjoying each other's company immensely. All to say we wanted to have a good weekend. I wasn't sure where life would take me after this road trip, but I did not think a return to Boston was in the cards. Six years living there, long winters, and a world of wonders weighed against it. This might be our last weekend before a long-term long distance relationship.
        <br><br>
            Isabel’s dismissive responses to my continued questions about if something had happened to the car did nothing to dilute my tone or rising worry. Pulling over to the side of I-90 somewhere between Albany and Rochester on a sunny, blustery, fall day, the first car investigation of the trip ensued. The hood was raised, manual brought out, phones sent into action. Much to our novice delight, 10 minutes later we had the working theory that it was a blown fuse, one that controlled the interior lights, clock, odometer, and a couple other things. The details in the manual and our observations matched up. Unable to get the broken fuse out of the power connecter box, an item whose existence we had just learned of, we hopped back in the car and proceeded on our way, our worry eased that anything serious was actually wrong. 
        <br><br>
            Not yet well acquainted with the practice of arguing we laughed about how we have gotten a bit taken away.

            Darkness descended right around the time when we were arriving at Niagara Falls. Isabel forgot to bring her passport so we were relegated to sticking on the US side. All the pictures which pop into your mind when you think of the falls are from the Canadian side. The US side looks down from the top of the falls, whereas the Canadians have the full expanse of the falls which makes for some great pictures. 
        <br><br>
            We found the US side absolutely exhilarating though. Isabel had been to the falls a few times but always from the Canadian side, and found the view down the falls, especially from Luna Island, heart pounding. The water cresting over the edge and dashing down 150 feet onto massive boulders which had broken off the falls years before. Across the way there were massive lights of rotating colors illuminating the falls for the evening onlookers. The light interacting with the mist, occasionally letting enough rays through to give us a view of the drenched boulders below, was mesmerizing. Iz and I went back and forth trying to explain the scene. “It's apocalyptic!” “Looks like the coastline of Maine when a big storm is bearing down.” “These rocks are what specs of dirt would be in a human shower.” From stop to stop within Niagara State Park we would run, just too excited to be there and pumped up from the other wordly scene below.

            The consensus best buffalo wings in Buffalo and a quick tour around Isabel’s old neighborhood, stately 1800’s mansions leftover from the golden age of the Erie Canal interspersed among urban blight and spots of gentrification, before we headed to the airbnb and the discovery of the missing suit bag. 
        <br><br>
            Friends from Isabel’s old job joined by significant others and siblings had all rented a house in Ellicottville, a little ways out of Buffalo, as our home base for Fall Fest, the biggest harvest festival in Western New York, and invited us to join for the weekend. The result was 16 people in an AirBnb with beds for 9, plus two couches. Isabel and I were assigned to the top bunk of a twin bed bunk bed. We would be getting very cozy for our final weekend together. 
        <br><br>
            Fall fest turned out to consist of a few stages for live music, 100 or so street fair vendors, an assortment of fried foods, and tons of people, all situated in this very picturesque town a bit outside of Buffalo. Two story brick buildings with cute shops, the classic white steeple church, and beautiful fall foliage. Isabel’s friends were super nice, we spent our days drinking and eating our way through fall fest, and our nights fooling around trying not to wake our fellow bunk mates.

        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
        <p>
            Roads were the lifeblood of my trip. I was on an interstate or U.S. highway almost entirely when I was getting from place to place. Most of that time consisted of setting cruise control to 80mph and doing my best to not fall asleep as I sped across some supersized state. This was expected when I departed Boston. Distances would be jammed into tight time frames, so lollygagging on backroads at night trying to discover new things was out of the question. What I did not expect was how much the history of our highways fascinated me, or how well their story explained the reasons for much of what I was seeing around me. So much so that when I felt the desire to put my trip on paper, which would undoubtedly peak after completely failing at a happy hour to explain my favorite part of the trip, I also felt like the story could not properly be told without also talking about the things floating around my head while on the road. Thus, scattered amongst the narrative of my trip, I will be splicing in topics that I found particularly relevant to my travels. Sometimes I searched out the topic, like when I downloaded a book about the National Parks before I left Boston, others presented themselves, like when I didn’t understand why I saw tons of wind turbines in Iowa, but few in neighboring ND, SD, and NB, even though those states sat on the best wind producing land in the country, so I downloaded a book on wind energy. I hope by talking about them you gain the context for why I was so excited to visit Yellowstone or see the oil rigs of West Texas and thus you enjoy the book more. Either way these are not my original thoughts, more excerpts of books I listened to while on the road combined with subsequent research and personal experiences. For this section most of my information comes from Big Roads by Earl Swift, a remarkably engaging book given the topic. 
        </p>

            In 1892 horses in New York City produced 6,000 gallons of urine and 2.5 million pounds of manure per day. With a horse for every six of the city’s residents, the city was drowning in an equine stench. Combined with the cost of feeding and keeping the horses in good health, equal to the cost of maintaining the nation’s rail system, horses were begging to be replaced. Today, I was cruising along at 80mph on an interstate highway headed west; smooth, well-paved, at least two lanes in each direction, 15ft median, banked curves, and no more than 3% curves, these roads give the driver freedom, speed, and comfort unimaginable 120 years ago. They are also the product of the largest public works project in history and the culmination of a saga that explains how and why much of the United States looks the way it does today. 
        <br><br>
            Carl Fischer, born 1874, a sixth-grade dropout, prankster, and salesman, was transformed by his visit, with friend and future racing legend Barney Oldfield, to America’s first auto show at Madison Square Garden. He returned to Indianapolis transfixed by these new mechanical buggies, sold his bicycle shop, and opened the Fisher Automobile company, the first auto dealership in the United States. In order to drum up sales he performed outlandish stunts: he dropped a Stoddard Dayton car from a sixth-floor downtown window to show how sturdy they were and then had it driven from the scene; another time he attached a balloon to a Stoddard Dayton and flew out of town, promising to drive back from wherever he landed. Indianapolis loved it and Fisher became a local celebrity. The issue was that, no matter what he did on the sales front, American vehicles and the roads available to drive them on were woefully inferior to their European counterparts. 
        <br><br>
            At the turn of the 20th century, the most common road improvement was to grade a dirt path in an attempt to smooth out its humps and bumps. A step up was a sand and clay mixture spread over an earthen bed which drained well and packed down hard with use. Above that was a gravel road that needed constant redressing due to constantly scattering pebbles. At the top of the pecking order was Macadam: a layer cake construction of crushed rock. Macadam consisted of a bottom level of large broken stones that were passed over with a heavy roller. Smaller broken stones were spread atop and pressed again by a heavy roller. Rock dust was then sprinkled on top of all that, watered down, and rolled a third time. Under the weight of the rollers, the rocks would stitch together forming a relatively smooth and stable surface. Yet in 1909, of the countries 2.2 million miles of roads, only 8% had been improved in any way. During the rainy season, these unimproved dirt paths would become impassable and maroon farmers away from market for weeks at a time. Cars were not much better, with hand-cranked starters, no tops, constant flat tires, and liable to loud backfires. 
        <br><br>
            Fisher’s solution was to build an auto racing track where the best cars and road materials of the day could be tested and improved. With his hometown of Indianapolis vying with Detroit as the auto capital of the nation, he figured it would be as good a place as any to build his track. Using the finest technique of the day, bituminous macadam, Fisher constructed a 2.6-mile track with perfectly banked corners. Driving legend and friend Barny Olefield remarked, “two miles per minute can be made with no greater danger [on the curve] than on the flat.” Unfortunately, the macadam construction, though sturdy at slow speeds, was not capable of remaining stitched together under the strain of solid rubber tires spinning at high speeds. On the first day of racing, just halfway through a 250-mile race Louis Chevrolet caught a rock through his goggles and had to be walked to the hospital. Then during the last race on the final day of the opening weekend, the front tire of the car driven by local boy Charles Merse exploded and his car went careening into the crowd, killing many. AAA threatened to boycott any future races if the track was not completely overhauled and the local coroner blamed the deaths on the inadequate track conditions. Fisher vowed for a complete overhaul, and with the help of friend Arthur C. Newby repaved the entire track with 3.2 million 10 lb bricks. Thus the brickyard was formed and two years later at the first Indy 500, 80,000 spectators were in attendance. 
        <br><br>
            Fischer, as well known and connected as anyone in the auto business at this point, next turned his attention to a transcontinental road. Cars were flying off lots as quickly as they could be produced. Vehicle registrations were on the brink of topping 1 million in 1912, having quadrupled in four years. People loved the sense of freedom the car offered and found them far more sanitary than their equine counterparts. Much cheaper too, after factoring in the cost of maintaining the buggies drive train. What was lacking were good roads to drive them on. Any ride into the country was an adventure requiring a four-foot plank, multiple spare tires, mechanical knowhow, and sometimes a tent if things went south. And that was when conditions were good. In the rainy season, dirt roads turned into mud and transportation was put on hold. Fisher had little faith that government was up to the task. “The highways of America are built chiefly of politics, whereas the proper material is crushed rock or concrete.” He thought it was up to industry to lead the way and show what was possible. He envisioned a transcontinental highway spanning a dozen states from New York to California. Dry, smooth, safe and not just passable, but comfortable in the rainy seasons. At a dinner in Indianapolis of 50 or so industry leaders, Fisher unveiled his plan. The highway would follow existing roads for much of its length, new construction connecting just those pieces which failed to connect, and then over time upgrading the entire highway to a uniform standard. Industry would provide the materials for the job, costing about $5000 per mile, and the public the muscle, with volunteers and local governments actually doing the labor. “Let’s build it before we are too old to enjoy it!” he implored his audience. 
        <br><br>
            After lavish scouting trips, with western governors promising the moon and more to the passing highwaymen, the newly named Lincoln Highway’s routing was decided based on which was the shortest path. Leaving New York it would follow a well-established route down to Philadelphia and across the midsections of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, to the outskirts of Chicago, before charting a new path through Cedar Rapids Iowa, Omaha Nebraska, and Cheyenne Wyoming, onto the old pony express trail through Salt Lake City all the way to San Francisco. On Halloween day 1913 the Lincoln was dedicated with fireworks, dances, and speeches in all the towns along the route. Over the next couple of years, these towns took pride in improving their sections of the highways. New Jersey remade its section in brick and concrete. In Illinois, thousands of adults and children voluntarily wielded picks and shovels trying to make their section the finest along the entire route. The improvements made a difference. Double the traffic passed through Ely Nevada in 1915 than the year earlier. Fish Springs Utah saw an uptick to 225 cars from 52 two years before. One driver even traveled the entire length in 6 days, 10 hours, and 59 minutes.

            Soon imitators were everywhere. The Jefferson Davis Highway from DC to SF by way of New Orleans; The Lakes to Gulf Highway from Duluth Minnesota to Galveston Texas; Ficher’s new project, the Dixie Highway from Chicago through Indy and Nashville, to his new development on a sandbar in Florida; and 250+ other named trails. More than 40 crossed Indiana and 64 were registered in Iowa alone. With each trail came a unique blaze design, tacked to trees, fences, and telephone poles, along its route. The Lincoln’s for example, was red, white, and blue, with a black capital L on the white stripe. The trouble was that the trails overlapped, a single stretch of road could be co-opted by a half-dozen trails, and the telephone poles could end up looking like a bunch of help wanted posters. Thus deciphering where one blaze ended and the next began, and which blaze you were supposed to follow, was a dangerous proposition, especially when many of the trails were more branding than improved road. They were a patchwork and inconsistent, but in total, they created our nation’s first interstate highway system. Further progress would have to wait until after The Great War.

            Part two of our highway story begins as Americans returned from the Great War victorious, and took to the streets like never before. 1,396,892 cars were produced in 1919, the first year after the war; 1,731,435 cars two years after that. The cobweb of trail associations with their semi-improved roads wasn’t cutting it. The call for a national grid of federal highways became deafening. With the speedy passage of the AASHO (The American Association of State Highway Officials) bill on Nov 9, 1921, they had their answer. States would remain the source of highways plans and the federal government the enforcer of design, construction, and maintenance standards. Each state was to designate a system of roads on which all federal aid was to be spent and which did not exceed 7% of the state’s total mileage. Additionally, each road within the system was to be labeled as either a primary or secondary road. The former being of an interstate nature, the latter connecting farms to market, small towns to one another, and other strictly local destinations. With its passage, the single most important ingredient of our modern road system came into being. 
        <br><br>
            At the head of its implementation stood Thomas Macdonald, an Iowan curmudgeon, who as a kid required his younger sibling to call him sir, and would go on to serve as highway chief for six consecutive presidents. Called chief by everyone, including his wife, he was a meticulous engineer who had the respect and trust of everyone in Washington. Facts, figures, and research were the backbone of the department’s decisions under his leadership. Thus after the department sent maps to the 48 states asking for their primary and secondary road candidates, he asked a trusted young engineer Edwin W. James to lead a committee to come up with an internal model of where they thought roads should go, so the department could better judge the quality of the state’s choices. For this task James collected the population totals for each county from the previous census, plus four economic indicators: agricultural production, manufacturing output, mineral yield, and income from forest products. Then he assigned a number of 100 to a state’s total population and a number to each county based on its percentage contribution. He repeated the exercise for the four economic indicators. Averaging the numbers gave a quick and dirty gauge for a county’s relative importance. James then shaded in each county, darker for increased importance within the state. Once finished the committee had a map with best to worst routing possibilities staring them in the face. Good routes would be darkly shaded and go through the more important or economically rich counties. It would also be easy to see that a state's choice was clearly erroneous, if it went through lightly shaded counties. The state’s nominations started rolling in and for the most part adhered to the federal model. In total the proposed roads would stretch 168,881 miles and reach 90% of the nation’s population, with not one or two transcontinental routes but dozens.
        <br><br>
            Next up was the naming of the new roads. At a joint meeting of state and local highwaymen led by Macdonald, four pillars of road design were hammered out. First, it was quickly agreed to number the nation's roads rather than naming them and to choose the routes to be included before applying the numbering. Second, Frank Rodgers of Michigan doodled a shield like that which adorns the $1 bill and passed it to Edwin W. James who added a small US over a large route number and the name of the state above the shield’s crown. The design was approved on the spot as the market which would identify all the routes included on the numbered system. Third, the men formally adopted the red, yellow, green, stop light sequence. And finally, they approved many road sign designs, one of which was the octagonal stop sign, painted black on yellow at the time because a durable red paint would not be available until the mid 50s. The actual numbering of the system was delegated to a committee chaired by James to decide. AB Fletcher, a former California highway chief, came to James proposing the grandest highway of them all, stretching from the top of Maine down to the southern tip of Florida in Key West, with the fitting name of highway 1. Thinking about it James wondered where 2, 5, 10 and 50 would be laid. A pattern suggested itself. “It stares one in the face, it is so simple and adjustable.” He would assign even numbers to all the east west highways and odd numbers to all those running north south. The numbering would be lowest in both directions in the northeast corner of the country at Maine’s border with Canada and would climb as one moved south and west. One or two digit numbers would denote principal highways, with three digit numbers signaling a spur or variant of a main route. To bring more order the major transcontinental routes going east west would have numbers ending in 0 and the most important north south highways would have numbers ending in 1. Thus with route 2 running east west in the northernmost climbs and route 98 running deep in the south, route 50 was almost guaranteed to run like a belt across the country’s middle. Likewise the intersection of routes 21 and 60 would indicate you were towards the east and just a little south of center. Unfortunately, when the agriculture secretary signed off on the plan, there were scores of complaints from trail associations about their assigned numbering or lack of inclusion and from states about their lack of major routes. The most serious complaint came from Kentucky Governor William J. Fields, who pointed out route 60 did not run from the east coast to the west as one might predict, but from Chicago on a long arching route through St. Louis, Tulsa, and Albuquerque to Los Angeles. US 50 missed Kentucky to the north and US 70 missed it to the south, so US 60 in theory should go through the very important state of Kentucky. With a contingent of his state’s congressmen, Fields took his case to the chief. Macdonald was won over by Fields’ use of logic to point out the flaws in the map. The route from Newport News VA to Springfield MO, running through Kentucky would now be named US 60 and the Chicago to LA route renamed route 66. And thus the historic route 66 was born! That was not the only anomaly in the numbering though. Highways braided, sometimes in their proper sequence, but other times not at all. US 11 for instance curved so much at its southern end that it ended west of route 49. The Lincoln, the nation’s first mother road, became route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming, before turning into a half dozen other numbers towards its end. The last contribution to highway history the Lincoln would make was in Woodbridge NJ where it was upgraded with a novel grade separation allowing the motorist to turn right or left onto the other road without having to stop. Named for its appearance from above, we know it today as a cloverleaf and it was the first of its kind in the states. 
        <br><br>
            The very next year after the AASHO bill’s passage, 10,000+ miles of federal aid highways were built, with Motor Life Magazine saying of Macdonald, “At his nod millions move from the US Treasury. Neither Morgan, nor Rockefeller, nor Carneigie, ever had the spending of so much money in so short a period of time.” Meanwhile the automobile industry continued to boom. In 1922 Essex developed the first enclosed car, sealed off from the elements, making motoring a year round endeavor. In 1923 american factories produced 3.9 million cars and trucks with registrations topping 15 million. With all these new highways and new drivers, businesses started appearing on the roadside catering to the motorist. Lodging began simply with towns offering public campgrounds equipped with a tent site, fire ring, trash can, and parking spot. For profit campgrounds then sprang up boosting offerings such as little cabins for those not inclined to tents. The idea took hold and roadside cabin camps were available coast to coast. Some went as far as offering Simmens or BeautyRest beds, and dropping cabin from their name in favor of motor court or motel. 
        <br><br>
            These new roads were not just a new toy for the weekend joy ride though, they were fundamentally changing the appearance of their surroundings. When personal speed had topped out at a horse's trot cities tended to be compact and mostly circular in shape. The invention of commuter rail allowed workers to live along the rail lines; resulting in development like the spokes of a wheel as the train lines radiated out from the city center. The advent of the car filled in the in between places and then began to grow outwards. 
        <br><br>
            It did not take long for the new US highways, built right through the center of towns, to start clogging up with the incredible influx of new vehicles. As they did the bypass movement began. The theory went that by building a route around the city much of the traffic would be diverted around the clogged center heart. Unfortunately, it would be discovered that most of traffic was intra-city with a very small contribution being made by through travelers. Journeys of less than 30 miles accounted for 88% of all trips, and those of greater than 500 miles accounted for less than .1%. The bypass failed in another way as well. With cities growing like a stain outward a new bypass would in 5 years be gobbled up by the city. Businesses would sprout up on its edges and a new bypass would need to be built even farther out. 
        <br><br>
            By the 1940s people came to see that the US highway system, and subsequent bypasses, were not the solution to all their congestion troubles. As Benton Mackay, the father of the Appalachian Trail, said of the US highways, “the flanks are crowded with food stands, souvenir shops, and billboards, each an eyesore, and parking lots and driveways a potential hazard….A break from America’s equine past required a highway completely free from horses, carriages, pedestrians, towns, and grade crossings. A highway built for the motorist and kept free from encroachment except for the filling stations and restaurants needed for his convenience.” He was asking for a grade separated, limited access highway with all the fluff removed from its sides.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Little did Mackey know but a plan for such a system was already underway. In 1938 Macdonald got called to a meeting with FDR in the White House where the president drew six blue lines, three vertically from north to south, and three horizontally from coast to coast. He was intrigued with the idea of building such roads and asked the chief to look into the matter and report back. 
        <br><br>
            A few weeks later Macdonald received a similar request from Congress to report on the feasibility of such transcontinental routes. Titled, Toll Roads and Free Roads, the report was split into two parts, on the feasibility of transcontinental toll roads, and an alternative conceived of by the bureau. In summary it said that the six transcontinental routes were buildable sure enough, but that they would not address the country's true highway needs, nor recover their costs in tolls. The cost of such a system would be 184 million per year through 1960, but by the most optimistic estimate they would recover only 72.4 million in tolls each year. Even the NJ to CT section, the busiest in the system, would fail to break even. Plus coast to coast traffic amounted to only 300 cars per day. Only 800 cars travelled to the west coast from any location east of the Mississippi. Such demand did not justify a huge public outlay. Macdonald thought that an overbuilt road was every bit as shameful as a deficient one. Unless it was justified economically, it failed, regardless of its engineering. 
        <br><br>
            Part two of the report, the alternative, suggested a 26,700 mile system of free highways which was the first blueprint for the modern interstate highway system. It’s millage would be twice that of FDR’s six transcontinental routes with most of its legs not superhighways but two laners, no more and no less than their usage demanded. The second part of the report also went out of its way to emphasize the need for urban highways. Congestion wasn’t caused by thru traffic mixing with local. It was caused by a multitude of small movements by locals. For example, of the 20,500 vehicles entering DC each day, only 2,269 or 11% were by-passable. The answer wasn’t to bend a highway around a city, but to drill it right through its middle. As for tolls, they had no place on these or any road. Roads were a birthright akin to public schooling. Plus tolls saddled engineers with a no win situation; to attract users the toll road had to offer a better product than parallel free roads, which limited the possible improvements to those free roads no matter how badly needed they were. Alternatively, improve the free roads too much and your toll road would lose too many customers and require state subsidy. 
        <br><br>
            Looking past the war, FDR saw the need for re-incorporating millions of fighting men back into the economy and retooling the country’s high revving war industries once the fighting stopped. Thus in 1943 he sent an updated draft of the report to congress, urging prompt action to facilitate the acquisition of land, the drawing of plans, and the preliminary work which must precede actual construction. It received a warm reception on the hill and in 1944 congress incorporated the proposal into the annual highway bill with little fanfare. It went “There shall be designed within the continental United States a national system of interstate highways, and which specified such a system should not top 40,000 miles in length and should be so located to connect by routes direct as practicable the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers to serve the national defense and to connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the Republic of Mexico.” The bill also specified a quarter of each year’s appropriation could go towards building urban highways. Unfortunately, the bill provided no special financing for the system or a timeline of when construction would begin. Yet it was still a major step. It committed the interstates to paper, now all that was needed was to find the money to build them. 
        <br><br>
            Years passed and the need for the new Interstates only grew. Population numbers exploded. New Orleans doubled in size in the 40’s. SF multiplied 2.5 times its pre-war size. And more cars than ever were getting pumped onto the nation’s roads. In 1949 three fourths of all the cars on the planet were located in the US. New York alone thought it would cost $1 billion to restore its roads to the efficiency they enjoyed in 1930. 
        <br><br>
            In steps Eisenhower, commander of allied forces during World War II, and newly minted President of the United States. To my uneducated mind he was the father of the interstate, because well, his name was on the little blue signs on the side of the road, Eisenhower Interstate System above a ring of five white stars. Such a theory sounded nice when combined with two trips Ike took earlier in his career which showed him the necessity of good roads. The first was in 1919 when as a young officer he took part in a military caravan to the west coast along the Lincoln Highway that was felled by every type of misfortune a road trip back then was liable to. The second was advancing across the impeccably built German autobahns on the Allies march to Berlin. Wrong. The interstates were a done deal in every major aspect except for financing by the time he entered politics. On the day when FDR called the chief to his office and drew those six blue lines Eisenhower was serving in the Philippines as chief of staff to Douglas Macarthur. When FDR submitted the highway report to congress Ike was just taking command of allied forces in Europe. When the system received its first paltry $25 million allocation Ike was the head of the West’s cold war alliance. In fact by the time Ike took office in 1953 the system had been in existence for 8 years. Nevertheless as I drove on I-90 west out of Buffalo with the sparkling water of the Erie on my right, it was Eisenhower’s name on the little blue sign which adorned the shoulder of the road. That is because with some encouragement from Ike, congress passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 funding the system Macdonald and Fairbank had put on paper 18 years earlier. The bill stipulated 90% federal financing of a 40,000 mile interstate system to be built over the next 13 years. The money would come from new taxes on tires and gasoline which would be put into a new Highway Trust Fund to be used only for highways. 
        <br><br>
            The bureau, with a new head engineer Frank Turner, a soft spoken bus-riding Macdonald protege who had proven himself on the Alaska Highway and by helping rebuild the Philippines after the war, had been busy in the intervening years testing the best materials and designs for the new system. For signage they hired a corps of engineers to drive around a parking lot at night perring at signs containing six words, balk, farm, navy , stop, zone, and duck, in different combinations of typeface and spacing. Green, blue, and black signs were also tried. Nearly 6 in 10 favored a green background, up and down lettering was prefered to all caps, and as spacing between letters increased so did the distance at which people could read them. To determine the proper road material, six test loops were built of varying paving material and thickness, 836 sections in all, on which army transport soldiers would drive 126 trucks around in circles for 19 hours per day for 2 years. By the end the soldiers had racked up 17 million miles. The conclusion, the thicker the pavement and subgrade, the better. Since the numbering system of the US Highways had worked so well it was recycled with a few minor alterations. To avoid confusion of overlapping numbers between the two systems it was proposed that no state have an interstate and US highway with the same number within its borders. To accomodate this the interstates would be lowest in the south and west and highest at Maine’s border with Canada. Plus, they would ditch I-50 and I-60 to avoid overlapping across the county’s middle. Additionally, the major north south routes would now end in 5 instead of 1. So if you were at the intersection of I-10 and I-5, it meant you were in the south western most part of the states. It also meant that for a road like I-90, which most Bostonians think starts at their city’s airport, actually starts all the way west in Seattle, and terminates at Logan.
        <br><br>
            Designed, tested, and now finally financed, the largest public works project in history was underway. Billions started to flow from the governments purse strings, each one creating 48,000 full time jobs for a year, and consuming  16 barrels of cement, 1 billion pounds of steel, 18 million pounds of explosives, 123 million gallons of petroleum products, 152 billion pounds of aggregate, and enough earth to bury NJ knee deep. 
        <br><br>
            By 1962 about 12,500 of 30% of the system was open to traffic and another 34 miles were opening every week. They were fast, safe, and Americans absolutely loved them. They loved that they could follow an impulse wherever they chose without surrendering space to a four smelling stranger. They loved the act itself, the feel of the engine under their control. In ____ they topped the projections of miles driven for 1970. Americans did not have an automotive life foisted upon them. They did not buy homes far from work or forsake mass transit or pave over their cities because they were manipulated into doing so. They wanted roads, they wanted the interstates, and they wanted them pronto. 
        <br><br>
            Just as with the US Highways, the changes brought by the new roads affected life far off from its paved borders. Small towns bypassed by the interstates found their livelihoods vanish. A gas station on US 80 lost 80% of its customers when I-20 was built. A motel on historic Route 66 in Qualpo Oklahoma bought a few years before for $28,000 was now on the market for $5,000 and finding no takers. Manufacturing left cities for cheap, abundant land near the interstates, which provided them with a ready distribution network. Chrysler cited the proximity of I-90 for building a $850 billion factory in tiny Belvadere Illinois, and I-44 for its construction of an assembly plant in the Ozarks of Missouri. Led by jobs and the desire for a house and a yard, the suburbs boomed. No longer able to locate themselves on the road’s shoulder, housing and shopping developments migrated to exits and radiated out from there; nucleated development it would come to be called. With people and manufacturing jobs leaving, cities’ central business districts began to fall apart. Mass transit withered in the new environment, with low density developments out in the suburbs and jobs spread out all over the place, there were not enough common destinations to make fixed rail lines viable. The only form of transportation suited to this new urban sprawl was the very agent of its change, the car. Thus, in a sick twist of logic, highway men believed that only more and bigger highways could entice suburbanites to make the trek back into the city center and thus avoid a complete abandonment of downtown. 
        <br><br>
            The experience of driving changed as well. Everything was sped up. Restaurants began popping up at exits catering to the road warrior in a hurry. They used shorthands, a logo, a color, or a certain shape of the roof to notify the driver of their presence. Their aim was to provide the driver with a predictable experience, such that a traveler might ask themselves, “should I search out a hit or miss local spot that could cost me an hour or should I grab a decent Mcdonalds burger at a great price and be back on my way in 10 minutes flat?” The latter option often won out, which is why today the look and feel of interstate exits with their identical chain restaurants have more in common with one another than they do with the state or locale they are in. 
        <br><br>
            Not everybody was overjoyed with these changes. SF had a vision of connecting the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge with a looping freeway along the peninsula's watery edge. What they got was a 57ft tall double decker expressway passing right in front of the Ferry Building and blocking the city’s residents from their historic waterway. The uproar of displeasure was so intense that on Jan 27, 1959 the board of supervisors approved a resolution opposing 7 of the 10 freeways planned for the city. Louis Mumford, the visionary social critique, found his way into the hearts of urban planners everywhere with his scathing critiques of the interstates. “The experts have innocent notions that the problem can be solved by increasing the capacity of the existing traffic routes, or multiplying the number of ways getting in and out of town, or providing more parking spaces for cars. Roads in NYC were designed for a city of four story buildings. Now in effect we have piled three NYC’s on top of one another. The roadway and sidewalks flanking them should, if they are kept at the original ration, be 200 ft wide, the current width of a NYC block.” He went on, “Want to save the cities? Forget about the motor car, the solution laid in restoring a human scale to urban life, in making it possible for the pedestrian to exist. A choice was looming, for either the motor car will drive us all out of the cities, or the cities will have to drive out the motor car.” The most surprising critic of the new urban highways though was the man who spurred their financing. In 1959, on a drive outside Washington to Camp David, Ike’s limo bogged down in traffic due to construction of a new interstate. Riled, Ike demanded an explanation for this was far too close to Washington to comply with Eisenhower’s notion of a largely rural intercity system. An examination of congressional intent insued, but it concluded that every study on which the program had been based was explicit, the country’s highway needs were sharpest in the cities; congress had read those studies, congress had seen the proposed routes drawn out on a map, congress had wanted urban routes. Eisenhower's displeasure with his own system would have to remain just that.
        <br><br>
            The collective acrimony over the damage urban interstates pushed congress in 1968 to require two hearings on federal-aid highways. The first, a corridor hearing, at which taxpayers could speak their minds on a highway’s location. The second, a design hearing, at which they would have the opportunity to affect the projects size and style. In addition, from then on, anyone unhappy with a state highway commission’s decision could appeal the matter directly to the feds on any one of 21 grounds: these included, the state had failed to weigh neighborhood character, property values, natural or historic landmarks, conservation, or the displacement of households or businesses. The grounds for appeal were so commonplace that every remaining interstate project was almost sure to be challenged, and left in a perpetual state of appeals. 
        <br><br>
            This marked the beginning of the end for highway building in America. Some of the more difficult portions of the interstate system dragged on for years, but for the most part the roads then are the roads now. The highway program had been bigger than the space program or atomic energy, and had delivered on much of its promise. 70 mph on the flat was attainable year around, and the fatality rate on American roads was just 2.52 per million miles driven, down from 16 in 1929. The cost to uproot and pave over livelihoods became too damn high to build anymore though. As time went by, those cities where the need for highways had been greatest, began calling for public transportation. People saw how the car had gutted many downtowns, leaving them ghostly quiet in the post work darkness. Instead they wanted a return of the tangled, creative, feverish energy only a pedestrian focused metropolis could provide. 
        <br><br>
            In 1982 they were successful in splitting the Highway Trust Fund in two with the new part designated for mass transit. Congress also authorized states to scrap existing federal aid highway plans and transfer the money to a mass transit project if they wanted to; thus states would no longer have to turn down federal aid if they did not want to build yet another highway. 
        <br><br>
            Highwaymen, for their part, could not understand why they were becoming so maligned. Sure a few urban routes necessitated serious upheaval, but as a whole the interstate system had been built quickly, efficiently, and provided a massive boon to the communities it passed through. Turner viewed highways as windfalls if you counted the amount of time they saved the taxpayer, the lives they spared, and the goods they carried. They were the only government activity which repaid the taxpayer with interest, and they more than compensated for whatever damage they caused. 
        <br><br>
            Turner was no foe of mass transit either, in fact, he often spoke keenly of the need for it, of how no one mode of transportation could answer all of a city’s needs. In fact he was downright bullish on the idea, as long as it was provided by the bus, a form of transportation he had commuted on for much of his career. He firmly believed rail base transit would not and could not attract enough riders to justify the fortune it would cost to build, partly because it could not be adapted to changing travel patterns. Cities had changed since the days of the street car, they were now spread too far and wide for fixed rail to take many people from where they were to where they wanted to go. Buses on the other hand made excellent sense. 50 or 60 could move as many people as 3,000 cars, provide almost door to door service, and follow routes that could be adjusted as needed. Plus, they piggy backed on an investment already in place, thus requiring no costly new infrastructure. Like all of his views, his opinion on the bus was supported by research, by statistics. He could cite a 1962 study which found buses and subways moved people for about the same cost, 3.2 cents per person per mile, but that buses were far cheaper to put into service. He acted on his beliefs and in 1969 helped launch an experiment in the DC suburbs, reversible lanes in the median of 1-95 set up for buses alone. When the Washington Post staged a race between a car and bus making the same 11 mile commute, the bus won by 32 minutes. Soon commuters by bus outnumbered their traffic jammed colleagues. Transit officials had to quadruple the bus fleet in order to keep up with demand. In the end the experiment trimmed the highway’s daily load by an estimated 3,140 vehicles per day. 
        <br><br>
            “Buses are the answer, the only answer,” Turner said. He could not fathom why environmentalists, the press, and the anti-highway activists didn’t embrace the bus, or why they were so smitten with rail based transit. “The infinite combinations of routings and schedules required by today's urban citizenry dictates that any transportation system must provide flexibility of route, destination and schedule. That’s why fixed route systems, which are basically spoke lines connected to a downtown hub, have such a hard time financing themselves in the fair box. And if they cannot support themselves in the fair box then isn't this a good warning that they may be failing to provide that service which the customer wants?”
        <br><br>
            His favorite whipping boy became the DC metro, a system covering 98 miles at a cost of $3 billion. An amount roughly equal to the capital regions expenditure on roads since the founding of the nation, and about $4,000 for every household. “What a huge capital expenditure to provide for the movement of about 5% of the transportation load within DC’s metropolitan area,” Turner quipped. “Just the annual interest on the debt would buy about 5,000 new buses every New Year’s morning for the whole life of the metro.”
        <br><br>
            I do not have the knowledge or inkling to debate the merits and drawbacks of the urban interstates. Growing up in New York City I saw how valuable the subway and buses were to the millions of people who took them everyday. I either walked or took public transit everyday to school and enjoyed the eclectic creatures I’d see everyday. On the flip side I have also seen how used interstates like the Cross Bronx ( I-95 ), the Deegan ( I-87 ), and the LIE ( I-495 ) are every single day with commuters, delivery trucks, and buses. Without them and the Robert Moses built parkways it would be a nightmare moving across the city at any time of the day. Thus, are they valuable to the city now, yes. Were they worth the destruction of East Tremont and the countless other neighborhoods they drill through, I am not anywhere close to being able to judge. The rural interstates on the other hand have been an unquestionable success. They save lives, time, and open up opportunities for millions of businesses. Maybe Fisher was right about the politics of his time, but in my opinion, the interstates and the US highways are an example of government at its best; building something that everybody wants, but no person, business, or state, has the ability to build themselves.

            That near universal experience of learning a word and then seeing it everywhere, happened to me all the time with the information learned by listening to Big Roads. I now spotted sets of old abandoned cabins by the side of US highways. I saw urban sprawl morph into nucleated development into empty pasture the farther out of town one went. I appreciated the desire for the interstates when strip malls on the shoulders of US highways made the roadway clogged and dangerous. I now understood what direction roads were headed just from parsing the road number and its prefix. My imagination went wild driving across Utah picturing drivers getting bogged down in thigh high dust on this very terrain when on the old Lincoln Highway. Listening to this book was like being given the prism through which America’s physical development makes sense.
