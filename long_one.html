	<h2 id='h-1' slot='h-1'>Boston</h2>
    <p>My reasons for the trip were a bit of a mystery even to myself. For a couple of months I had offered various thoughts to friends, none of which felt particularly accurate. Part certainly came from being without a bed to call my own, having let my lease go at the end of August. I had the ambition of playing professional golf, and fall was to be my time to try to qualify for the tour. After miserable results during my summer tournaments though, it was utterly clear that I was not ready. Such an attempt costs an entry fee of around $5,000, so nothing to take lightly if you are not feeling confident. Thus I found myself in September no longer living with my best pals from college, and without much of an idea for what came next.</p>

    <p>This was only a fraction of the reason though. A new lease is not hard to find in Boston, and the ties to a great group of college friends and my girlfriend were strong incentives to stay. Instead, the call to the road came mostly from desire rather than necessity. A New York City kid, schooled and living in Boston, I was decidedly unacquainted with much of the country. From a youth spent playing golf and soccer tournaments, I knew the eastern seaboard from Maine to North Carolina, but had only jetted in and out of a handful of other places around the country. This fed a sense of claustrophobia and restlessness.</p>

    <p>Growing up in a family where my father often referenced his great journeys across the country and around the globe, and in a country where individualism and exploration are part of its ethos, such a trip felt like a requirement of a well-lived life. Soon to be 25, I saw many a long path before me. Qualifying and playing golf into my 30s. Starting a company with its many early years of hard toil. A serious relationship and eventually the demands of a family. All roads leading away from free time and the long one. Maybe premature, but fleeting opportunities on the horizon and the sinking feeling of passing youth were strong factors in deciding to leave and traverse the states.</p>

    <p>This is not an exhaustive list of my reasons. Many more I have yet to suss out are lurking in the recesses of my mind. I haven't tried too hard to figure them out though. The important thing was that I was going.</p>

    <p>And so I found myself sitting in front of my boss, in a newly renovated yet still sparsely decorated office, asking what he thought about me working remotely.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My sister is in Houston. She is a reporter there. Growing up in New York, I have lived in Boston for six years now, with school and now Redline, and I am growing kind of tired of it.&rdquo; <br />
    &ldquo;Six years, I&rsquo;ve lived here for 43 years,&rdquo; Mark interjected. <br />
    &ldquo;Hahaha, yeah I don't know, I just want a change out of the northeast...and I was thinking about joining her in Texas. What do you think about me moving to remote work?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This was more than an arm&rsquo;s length from the truth, but I did not want to make it too complicated for him. I planned to depart in early October, with stops in Buffalo, Cedar Rapids, Rapid City, Denver, Jackson Hole, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Houston, and New Orleans by Christmas. For the past couple of years, rather than exchanging presents, my family took a trip. This year we were heading to New Orleans, which made it the logical time and place for the trip to end. Once January hit I planned on coming back east for a few weeks to visit my girlfriend and former housemates. Then heading back to Texas, possibly Houston, for February, March, and April, to prepare for the upcoming golf season. Houston was definitely a stop on the trip and possibly my location in the spring, but I told my boss Houston because working remotely from Texas sounded a lot better than working from the road on a 10,000-mile 3-month-long road trip. From my perspective, remote work was remote work, and as long as I was completing my assignments, it did not matter where I was located. I just needed my boss to say yes. I also thought there was little possibility that work would find out about the plan.</p>

    <p>For a pretty low key guy who gives his employees a long leash, Mark took a long while to consider this idea. For two weeks, I came into work thinking I&rsquo;d hear his decision. I&rsquo;d see Mark walk into my office and think he&rsquo;d say &ldquo;Owen, do you have a moment?&rdquo; and sweep his hand in the direction of his office; instead he would ask how progress was going on one customer ticket or another. Due to my initial procrastination in asking and Mark taking longer than expected in answering, it was late August at this point and my lease was up in 11 days. I needed to know where I stood, so if I did not get approval, I could act quickly to find a lease starting in September.</p>

    <p>I walked into his office in the late afternoon, after Mark was finished with his multiple morning calls, and after I had time to complete enough work so I could give a positive status update if I was asked. Knocking on the door, &ldquo;Hey Mark, do you have a moment?&rdquo; Assent given with a nod of the head. &ldquo;Have you had a chance to review my request? My lease is coming up and I kinda need to know one way or the other.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, Houston, that's okay. Performance must stay high. Working remotely there are fewer remedies if performance drops.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you very much, Mark!! I do not see any reason why performance would drop.&rdquo; The two senior engineers on my team also worked remotely so all questions I had during a day of work had to be asked across the company chat app, Slack, anyway. My excitement made me pop up out of my chair and shake his hand. I was going, going on the long one.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>It had been over a month since I had been approved to work remotely, and I had spent my time bumming around Boston. September is a glorious month in the bay state, so I hung around, staying at Isabel&rsquo;s and on friends' couches. Wonderful activities ensued; a weekend on the cape with my housemates, a weekend in Newport with Isabel, a wedding of a family friend in the Berkshires. It was a charmed month. Not having a place to stay made my departure feel imminent and thus activities and emotions were at heightened levels.</p>

    <p>It was a month of extra rounds and toasts; toasts to the end of the college lifestyle and the past two years together. Friends from college, we had made the conscious decision that we wanted to live together after graduation. We thought at no other time of life were we going to be able to live with 3 of our best friends. Although we had various ideal paths for ourselves we thought living together would be an experience we would rue missing. It was more than we could have hoped for. Trying to explain such friendships always comes up short and sounds all too clique, but we really were guys who cared about one another. Thus this month was more than me leaving; a couple of our other friends had left a few months before and one of my housemates Zach was thinking of moving to DC come January, so the post-grad era was ending. Our friendships were likely at their most intense. We did not want it to, but life was moving us on.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Finally, I had all my stuff packed and on the curb next to my car at 9:15 on Thursday morning. Isabel had taken two days off work, the first to head north to visit her mother for her 60th birthday, and the second for us to drive out to Buffalo. I planned on staying at the housemates Thursday night and picking Iz up wherever her sister dropped her off Friday morning. Thus my box of snacks, my two bags of clothes, my suit bag, my golf bag, my camping gear, my kettlebell, my toolbox, and an extra pillow were all strewn on the wetness beside Norman. With Norman, a little two-door Hyundai Accent Hatchback, packing had to be deliberate. Golf bag on the left side, clothes bags on the top of the folded down back seats, snacks and camping gear on the flat nearest the trunk door, and finally pillow and kettlebell wedged behind the passenger seat.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Big road trip?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Indeed, I am driving cross country to San Francisco.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Oh my. I did that once. Nebraska was sooo goddamn boring. Flat and endless. What route are you taking?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;I-90! At least most of the way. Buffalo, Iowa, the Dakotas, Denver, Jackson Hole, San Fran!&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;A lotta driving. Best of luck. Have fun!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My phone said 9:41, I was quite late for work. I&rsquo;d need 29 minutes of speeding to make my morning meeting at 10:10. I jumped in the car and sped off, leaving my suit bag right there, on the 3ft tall rock ballast which marked the start of the stairs up to the yellow house, the first one on the right of Lee st.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>At work, I was in serious shit. I&rsquo;d gotten a bit confused about if Isabel and I were taking Friday off to drive to Buffalo early or if we were leaving after work on Friday. She had lived in Buffalo the year before and had been asking me to go for a while. This trip provided the perfect opportunity. Buffalo was on the direct route out, seven hours west on I-90 from Boston. We&rsquo;d discussed driving after work on Friday but it meant the weekend activities would be very cramped. On the other hand, leaving early Friday would require taking a day off, a commodity that Isabel was running low on. Confused about our decision, I did not realize my error until after I had put in my request to take the following week off. I am not proud of it, but I felt weird about asking for another vacation day given how nice they had been in granting me remote work, and so I kept procrastinating. I finally came up with the plan that I would ask for the day off because the packing was going very badly. In their minds, I was packing up and would be taking the following week off to drive down to Texas, where I would set up shop for the foreseeable future. I would say packing was going so poorly that I thought I&rsquo;d need to take Friday off in order to finish.</p>

    <p>But now I was late! It was 9:41 and I needed to ask this morning! I surely couldn't show up late to our already very leisurely 10:10 meeting and ask for the following day off! I sped. Through Cambridge, onto route 28, and up 1-93 to Woburn. I sprinted up the stairs, put my stuff down, composed myself, wiped the perspiration on my forehead, and walked into Mark&rsquo;s office for our morning meeting. The plan was to ask at the end of the meeting when Mark would ask &ldquo;Anybody have anything else?&rdquo; With the wording and tone of my request running through my head on repeat, Mark mentioned that he would be out the next day and thus no meeting. I started to think, to conspire. Not proud, not proud, very very guilty. In my dread I kept my mouth shut leaving the insidious plot of just not working on Friday. Without the morning meeting, nobody would check in on me, certainly not on a Friday. None of my work was time-critical and I would be able to make it up in the week I had actually taken off. And so I found myself picking up Isabel at 10:30 on a day when I was on the clock. Iz had made such a big deal about how hard it had been for her to take the day off that I had absolutely no courage to tell her about my mischievousness.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>The timing for Iz could not have been worse work-wise. Having been put on three upcoming deals, she had worked 12 hour days Monday-Wednesday, only to have to work in the car on the drive out. Huddled over her computer on her vacation day, her focus was so intense that she could not hear the outside world. My questions were not heard much less responded to. After four hours of that, plus not being able to listen to any of my downloaded books because Iz also wanted to listen to them, I was drowsy, testy, and was not having fun. I needed a short snooze and Iz had a call so we switched seats and Iz would talk as she drove.</p>

    <p>Waking up quite dazed and groggy, I looked down to see the car keys in my lap, my phone 56 minutes advanced, and the car parked in a service area. Confused, I shuffled out of the car to go to the bathroom and find Iz. Not finding her inside the building or outside on the benches I was befuddled. I went back to the car to get my water bottle, locked the car with the driver&rsquo;s side door button because the key fob seemed to have died, and returned to the building for a second search. I found her near an outlet, hidden by a massage chair, huddled over her computer, typing furiously. She had made it 35 minutes before pulling off and getting back online.</p>

    <p>Still drowsy but exasperated by our slow pace I said I would drive. Getting back in the car I pulled onto the highway and noticed there was definitely something wrong. There was a red light on the dashboard with the letters &ldquo;tpms&rdquo;, the clock was blank, the trip odometer had reset to 0, and the interior lights weren&rsquo;t working either. Thinking back to the service area I wondered if these were related to the car keys not being able to lock or unlock the car remotely. Asking Iz if anything had happened while she was driving, I got no response. Not knowing what was wrong with my car, but knowing something was definitely up, on the opening leg of a 5,000-mile journey, in the presence of a mute companion, my voice cranked up to a volume and tone much too dramatic.</p>

    <p>Having decided to start dating a year before we were both immensely pleased with how it was going. And I do mean decided. With our fathers being best friends from college and our families still close, we had discussions before making the plunge, not wanting to get wet if the relationship didn't have legs. Six months after giving it a shot we had looped the parents in on the situation, much to their audible chagrin. &ldquo;Don't screw this up for us.&rdquo; Regardless, no damage was done. A year in and we were enjoying each other's company immensely. All of this to say, we wanted to have a good weekend. I wasn't sure where life would take me after this road trip, but I did not think a return to Boston was in the cards. Six years of living there, long winters, and a world of wonders, weighed against it. This might be our last weekend before a long-term long-distance relationship.</p>

    <p>Isabel&rsquo;s dismissive responses to my continued questions about if something had happened to the car, did nothing to dilute my tone or rising worry. Pulling over to the side of I-90 somewhere between Albany and Rochester on a sunny, blustery, fall day, the first car investigation of the trip ensued. The hood was raised, the manual brought out, and phones sent into action. Much to our novice delight, 10 minutes later we had the working theory that it was a blown fuse, one that controlled the interior lights, clock, odometer, and a couple of other things. The details in the manual and our observations matched up. Unable to get the broken fuse out of the power connector box, an item whose existence we had just learned of, we hopped back in the car and proceeded on our way, our worry eased that anything serious was actually wrong.</p>

    <p>Not yet well acquainted with the practice of arguing we laughed about how we had gotten a bit taken away.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Darkness descended right around the time when we were arriving at Niagara Falls. Isabel forgot to bring her passport so we were relegated to the US side. All the pictures which pop into your mind when you think of the falls are from the Canadian side. The US side looks down from the top of the falls, whereas the Canadians have the full expanse of the falls, which makes for some great pictures.</p>

    <p>We found the US side absolutely exhilarating though. Isabel had been to the falls a few times but always from the Canadian side, and found the view down the falls, especially from Luna Island, heart pounding. The water crested over the edge and dashed down 150 feet onto massive boulders which had broken off the falls years before. Across the way, there were massive flood lights with rotating colors focused on the falls for the evening onlookers delight. The light interacting with the mist, just barely illuminating the drenched boulders below, was mesmerizing. Iz and I went back and forth trying to explain the scene. &ldquo;It's apocalyptic!&rdquo; &ldquo;Looks like the coastline of Maine when a big storm is bearing down.&rdquo; &ldquo;These rocks are what specs of dirt would be in a human shower.&rdquo; From stop to stop within Niagara State Park we would run, just too excited to be there and pumped up from the otherworldly scene below.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>From Niagara we headed to the consensus best buffalo wings in Buffalo and a quick tour around Isabel&rsquo;s old neighborhood, Gabriel&rsquo;s Gate. It is an old-timey restaurant in a two story house, with wood paneling, wooden bench seating, and huge animal busts peering down at out from above the bar. The food ain&rsquo;t fancy, just two dozen gloriously lathered wings with wooden discard bowls. Surrounding it is the neighborhood of Allentown, which contains a combination of stately 1800&rsquo;s mansions, leftover from the golden age of the Erie Canal, interspersed among vacant lots and spots of gentrification. Isabel pointed out some of her favorite haunts and told stories of this or that when somethings around us reminded her. A bit after 10pm we headed to the Airbnb.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bad, bad, not good.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;My jacket bag.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;You left it?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Bad.&rdquo; Shaking my head.<br />
    &ldquo;You left it at my apartment?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Worse.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;You left it with the roommates at 91?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Worse.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;You left it at J and Travis&rsquo;s?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Worse.&rdquo; Bumping my head against the side of the car now.<br />
    &ldquo;You left it on the street?&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;NOOOOOOO!&rdquo;, Isabel let out sympathetically. &ldquo;That's literally the worst-case scenario. My house or 91 and I coulda just sent it. What are you gonna do? The Dakotas and Jackson are gonna be cooold.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There followed a sizable pause to let the news sink into both of us. All of my jackets and warm weather clothes were MIA, left on the stoop of a random house on Lee St. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A cool fall evening bringing the bag&rsquo;s absence to my eye when I opened the trunk. Remaining was the sweatshirt on my back and about 10 t-shirts.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Friends from Isabel&rsquo;s old job joined by significant others and siblings had all rented a house in Ellicottville, a little way out of Buffalo, as our home base for Fall Fest, the biggest harvest festival in Western New York, and invited us to join for the weekend. The result was 16 people in an Airbnb with beds for 9 and two couches. Isabel and I were assigned to the top bunk of a twin bed bunk bed. It was to be a cozy final weekend together.</p>

    <p>Fall fest turned out to consist of a few stages for live music, 100 or so street fair vendors, an assortment of fried foods, and tons of people, all situated in a very picturesque town a bit outside of Buffalo. Two-story brick buildings with cute shops, the classic white steeple church, beautiful fall foliage, and lovely fall weather. Isabel&rsquo;s friends were super nice, and we spent our days eating and drinking our way through town.</p>

    <h2 id='h-2' slot='h-2'>The Dakotas</h2>
    <p>At 11:45pm I awoke from my slumber. Having pulled over at 8:30pm to take a one-hour nap, I somehow had slept for three hours and fifteen minutes. Just a bit outside Cleveland now, I had 8.5 more hours of driving to do before Noah&rsquo;s flight landed in Iowa at 1 pm the next day. Having left Isabel in Buffalo around 4 pm, I&rsquo;d cruised through a stunning section of Western New York, where leaves of yellow and red dotted the hills far on my left, vineyard after vineyard ticked by on both sides of me, and the sparkling blue of the Erie could be seen off in the distance on my right. The fading sun threw a golden light over the whole scene making it one of the prettiest sections of the entire trip.</p>

    <p>After making good time to Cleveland I took a pit stop in Cleveland Heights to take a look at my father's childhood home. He had lived there in his elementary school years and had been encouraging me to make the stop. It was a stately brick home on the corner, with a chatty couple sipping wine on the back patio. Other homes in the neighborhood were also very nice, many in the Tudor style, with full green lawns and a nicely sized backyard. Yet looking up prices online at dinner the houses in the neighborhood were mostly in the 200-300k range!</p>

    <p>I got a bit tired an hour later, four hours into the drive, and still 3.5 hours from my planned pit stop in South Bend, Indiana. That is when I decided to pull over into the service area to take a nap. Awake now and flustered by my unplanned hibernation, I got out of the car to take a piss, only to slip on some vomit spewed directly outside the driver&rsquo;s side door. Tough go, but at least I was fully recharged. I reevaluated, decided not to pee, and took off down the highway, lots of driving ahead of me.</p>

    <p>Usually, I like driving at night. For one there is much less traffic, but mostly I like that it means I am not wasting a day in the car. On my many trips back and forth from NY and Boston, I would usually leave around 9 pm, after dinner with the parents or a night hanging with the housemates, and complete the drive in 3:15 hours. It felt like I got two full days on either side of the drive. On the drive to South Bend though, I had the sinking feeling that I was missing out. The whole point of this trip was to see the in-between. To experience all the places that I had never been to before. But under the cover of darkness, the landscape's charms were hidden. Every road looks the same at night: black asphalt, painted lines, darkness above and on each side. And so Indiana passed by, a mystery to me. I decided in these wee hours to try and favor daytime drives so that I would not miss the in-betweens.</p>

    <p>A quick 5-hour stopover at a Motel 8 and I was back on the road. It was 8:01am and google maps predicted 4 hours and 58 minutes, just enough to beat Noah&rsquo;s plane in Cedar Rapids at 1 pm. Looking around, I realized I probably had not missed much in Indiana if it looked at all like Illinois. I-90 cuts through the outskirts of Chicago&rsquo;s sprawl and for a couple of hours it was nothing but wide concrete highways, billboards, spaghetti ramps, and hints of strip malls off to the sides. It was monotonous and depressing, such that the cornfields of Iowa were actually a joyous sight.</p>

    <p>Small farms of corn and soybean, Iowa was exactly as I had imagined. No place on the trip fit with its stereotype quite as well as Iowa. I mean that in a positive way. It looked like the Jeffersonian ideal. The farmhouses and silos were the only interruptions to the lines of agriculture flitting by row after row. It was mesmerizing watching out of the corner of my eye, each perfectly planted row going tick tick tick. Even the soybeans and grass fields had these perfectly sowed lines. An entire field of grass looked like matted hair from almost every angle until for a few brief moments the field came into perfect organization with crop lines going off into the distance.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the Cedar Rapids Airport was a funny experience being accustomed to the hustle and bustle of LaGuardia or JFK. Not a single car or person was in front of the single terminal airport. The sidewalk in front stretched for 500 ft and not a single soul was present. I leisurely parked right in front and hopped out, not worrying about a screaming traffic cop or honking taxis. Noah walked out a couple of minutes later and we took off, no sign of his fellow passengers or any airport personnel materialized.</p>

    <p>We didn't have any definitive plans for the week. We knew we wanted to go to Badlands National Park, Theodore Roosevelt National Park (Noah very much wanted to say he had been to North Dakota), and Mt. Rushmore in the Black Hills. The dates of when to do these things or the stuff we&rsquo;d do in between were unsettled. It was novel for both of us to spend a vacation like this. Usually, vacations were well-planned out affairs so as to maximize the activities that were possible. Or even on vacations whose purpose was relaxation, there was still a known place and routine to the day. Here we had the true road trip experience: young, excited, and untethered.</p>

    <p>While driving we decided on the Castle Trail at Badlands National Park for Wednesday so we&rsquo;d spend the rest of Monday and Tuesday tootling around Iowa and South Dakota. 9 holes of golf near Des Moines, a failed attempt at attending a 2020 presidential campaign event, a sightseeing stop at the Corn Palace in Mitchell SD, an active native American archeological site nearby, and a pit stop in Chamberlain South Dakota to try to fix Norman.</p>

    <p>The fuse had still not been fixed, the driver side visor had a tendency to dislodge and fall down 10 inches into the face of the driver whenever we hit a big bump, and the hood's screws had become loose causing the whole hood to shake vigorously at high speeds. Chamberlain was a small town on the banks of the Missouri River consisting of 20 or so businesses. Stop one, right in the center of town, the mechanic said he was sorry but he had a backlog of work that would take him into the following week. 2pm on a Tuesday in an all but forgotten town in South Dakota and the mechanic had a week worth of cars waiting?!? The mechanic was nice enough to recommend a place down the street but warned that the old man there hated foreign cars and might refuse to work on my Hyundai. Rather excited to meet such a character we were disappointed and perplexed when we found his store closed for the day, at 2:15 on a Tuesday. Thwarted, we were headed out of town when Noah spotted a NAPA Autoparts store and thought maybe they&rsquo;d lend us the tools to do the fixes ourselves. MVP of the Dakotas, John of Napa Auto Parts, showed us how to take the fuse out of the power connector box, sold us some gorilla glue for the visor, and lent us some wrenches needed for tightening the screws of the hood. It was a very satisfying feeling to do all of these small fixes, all for the mighty sum of $4.10. I felt slightly capable, almost handy. This plus changing the oil and oil filter myself before the trip had me feeling like I was starting to get a grasp of how cars worked, something I had always wished I knew.</p>
    <img src="/long_one_pictures/norman_visor.JPG"><figcaption>Noah holding up the visor as we drive</figcaption><br><br>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>&ldquo;Sssssss&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;AHHHHHH. HOLY SHIIIIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT. &ldquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;WAS THAT A RATTLESNAKE?&rdquo; Noah asked after we had darted 20 yards back up the trail.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;YEAH. It was fucking two feet away. I looked down and it was a foot in front of me and a foot off the trail.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We had seen signs warning of rattlesnakes when we had penned our names into the Castle Trail log, but holy shit! this one was right there. 4.1 miles down the trail. Now, with badlands on our left and grasslands to our right, we were a bit stuck. For much of the hike, the grasslands were relatively sparse and easy to traverse. Here, though, it was thick with brambles, plus we weren't sure if there were other snakes hidden nearby. The badlands, made from a very crumbly clay-like rock were poor for hiking. Footholds and handholds were likely to crumble beneath one's weight. Thus with a steep 15-foot slide marking the start of the badlands just a couple of feet off the trail on our left, looping around the snake on either side seemed untenable. We tried throwing rocks next to it, stomping and yelling, and shooing it with Noah&rsquo;s portable tripod, all to no avail. All we managed to accomplish was to make it coil up and hiss even louder. Not knowing how dangerous rattlesnakes are, but knowing they are venomous of some kind, we decided we didn't need to see the last mile of the trail and decided to turn around.</p>

    <p>Still only 10:27 AM, we&rsquo;d already had an eventful day. We had woken up at 5:45am to witness the sunrise, the golden rays illuminating the striated rocks layers which gave the badlands their character. One million years before all we would have seen was a gentle river flowing through grassland. 500,000 years from now, the erosion would be so complete that the jagged ridgelines and beautifully colored striations showing the rock layers would be gone, returning the land to gently rolling grassland. We had arrived at the perfect time to see the area at its most spectacular. The highest ridgelines 700ft and the badlands extending for a 30-mile stretch, we could compare the relative ages of rock layers from two very separate sections all while the sun peeked over the horizon.</p>

    <p>The only damper of the morning had been Noah&rsquo;s new phone. An iPhone 11 with three cameras on the back, a wide lens, portrait mode, and night mode included. I quickly realized that my iPhone 5 SE&rsquo;s photos were impotent. There was no point in me taking a picture if Noah was right there beside me taking the exact same shot. His photos would look so much better that I gave up trying, leaving my phone in my bag. For sunrise, I was his assistant recommending new viewpoints and angles that I thought might be good. On the trail, I wandered off into the outlying canyons of the badlands skidding and scurrying around as Noah paused and took professional quality pictures. What finally stopped all the picture taking was that snake. It scared the bejeezus out of us.</p>

    <p>Noah took the lead on our way back, conversation all but ceased, our eyes focused downward on the lookout for other slithering reptiles. I was definitely skittish, taking offense at every sound, but Noah tried to say he wasn't. However, he hilariously timed &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared.&rdquo; with the takeoff of a couple of birds in the grass; their wingbeats against the grass simulated the rattle of a rattlesnake shockingly well. Noah gave a yelp of fright and came running back up the trail like a scared Scooby Doo into the arms of Shaggy.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Stopping by the visitor center on our way out we bombarded the rangers with questions accumulated on the trail.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why are there some black sedimentary rocks interspersed in the runoff areas? They look very different than the crumbly rock of the badlands.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exactly right, they were brought down from the Black Hills all the way here by the river that eroded the badlands.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How common are rattlesnake attacks?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We have 5 or 6 every year.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are they deadly?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo; Not usually for full-grown adults. If you get treatment within the first 30 minutes you are usually okay. Longer than that and there can be some clotting of the blood caused by the venom, which can be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are there any large animals in the park? We kept looking out and all the way to the horizon we couldn&rsquo;t see a single one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yeah, there are more in the western section of the park. We have a herd of 3,000 buffalo. Or rather bison. Some bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and black-footed ferrets are also over there.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Like magic, as we headed out of the park through the western entrance, a cluster of bighorn sheep crossed the road right in front of us. 250lbs, with massive horns curved back behind them in a semi-circle, the sheep clomped their way across the pavement, paying absolutely no heed to the cars piling up. It was surreal being so close and made for a spectacular photo opportunity. Three male bighorn sheep grazed on the grass only a foot off the road, badlands rising 300 feet directly behind them, clear blue sky up above that. We gawked, Noah took photos, and I repeated &ldquo;Oh Wow, SO COOL!&rdquo; way too many times.</p>

    <p>Not five minutes down the road, we rounded a curve to see mammoth dark spots dotting an expanse of grassland. We pulled over onto a little dirt road to watch. The bison having shed their winter fir, had a thick mane of curly black hair covering their front half while their backsides were covered in a much thinner coat similar to that of a cow. Most were far off in the distance, heads down in the grass, chomping very audibly. Yet there was one right near the road and he WAS COMING CLOSER. At 2,000 pounds he weighed far more than my little Hyundai Accent. We froze and the beast walked mere feet in front of us to go scratch on a stop sign. Back and forth it lurched, trying to itch its shoulder, the poor stop sign getting yanked to and fro, 15 degrees forward, then 15 degrees backward.</p>

    <p>Stoked with our luck, bighorn sheep and bison RIGHT ON THE ROAD! when we hadn&rsquo;t seen a single other wild mammal all day, even from a distance, we happily started on our way up to North Dakota.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel about the scenic drives that almost every National Park has. Often a loop, they are designed to give the automotive visitor a quick hits album of what the park has to offer. I wanted to hate them, black stains that have no place in the most pristine lands our country has left. Yet I used them. They allowed me to see in a day what it would take a week of backpacking to see otherwise.</p>

    <p>Theodore Roosevelt National Park had one of the nicer scenic drives. A 35-mile loop, closed in one section because the badlands underneath had eroded causing the road to collapse, had five scenic stopping points.</p>

    <p>Stop one, the prairie dog settlements. These badlands of North Dakota were much farther along in the erosion process. The ranger in the visitor center said they were the friendlier version of Badlands National Park, their curves more rounded and vegetation far more plentiful. All of which made TR NP the perfect habitat for prairie dogs. About one foot tall, looking like oversized hamsters, they were everywhere. The crumbly rock made it easy for them to bury their homes and the vegetation made for a plentiful diet.</p>

    <p>I rushed at them, sprinting hard for 15 yards directly at them. It felt a bit wrong, against the ethos of the National Parks, but a plaque detailing their different calls had made me too curious. A repeating yap when they spot danger, a jump and yip when the danger disappears, and many variations in between. &ldquo;Prairie dogs have the most sophisticated vocal language ever decoded.&rdquo; With most of their natural predators dead long ago we spent 10 minutes just watching them scurry about cropping the grass around their homes to one inch tall. We weren&rsquo;t going to see any of their language if we didn't do something. My mad dash was in the name of science! One popped up, stood erect and gave a yelp, terrified of this rushing 165 pound man. All its neighbors heard the signal and scurried to their holes. This is how they survive. They keep their lawns short so predators can't sneak up, and they live in settlements by the thousands so someone is always on the lookout. The yelps kept coming, every two seconds. Then once I backed up, back onto the road, the vocal prairie dog jumped up, kicked its hind legs and yipped that all was safe again. Lawn mowing and neighborhood gossip resumed.</p>

    <p>Stop two, Buck Hill, a knob from which two rangers with binoculars were pointing out wildlife in the distance. A pair of feral horses over there. A group of Elk so far in the distance they were barely even specs. All around us rounded buttes with painted rock layers poking out between the grassy tops and wooded ravines. The Lakota people were the first to call this place &quot;mako sica&quot; or &quot;land bad.&quot; French-Canadian fur trappers called it &quot;les mauvais terres pour traverse,&quot; or &quot;bad lands to travel through.&quot; It&rsquo;s crumbly and very uneven terrain with few water supplies made the land terrible for farming and treacherous to cross. Thus to the natives and early white settlers this was undesirable land, especially in comparison to the flat grasslands we had driven through for four hours on our way here. As a result, this was some of the only virgin grassland in the country. The second-most biodiverse ecosystem in the world, behind only the rainforest, the US has only 32% of its virgin grassland left. The rest has at some point or another been plowed under, with agriculture, roads, and buildings the main culprits. Looking straight down as we hiked the short nearby trail, I thought I could see the increased biodiversity. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was looking for it, but each patch of ground I looked at was remarkably rich. Saltgrass, western wheatgrass, creeping juniper creeping in patches, sagebrush making cameos, very young pine saplings poking up, and some lichen looking stuff was near the ground and in-between everything.</p>

    <p>Stop three, an exposed old coal vein. Coal inside the earth can catch fire and when it does it creates a kiln like environment that bakes the clayey soil of the badlands. The result was bright red patches of ground where arrowhead sized shards of pottery covered the surface. We did the loop and were quite impressed with the scope of the area. The red was so vibrant and it was wild imagining the earth smoldering below us. That said, we left feeling like we must have made a wrong turn, we only saw a few small patches, no big vein as was described on the trailhead.</p>

    <p>Stop four, the eroded section of the scenic road. Along a curve around the side of a butte, the ground beneath had just given way, taking the pavement with it. The road now fifteen feet below, left a large drainage pipe sticking out from the side of the butte. The ranger inside said the fix would cost $1 million, not something in budget for a Park Service three billion dollars short on maintenance work. It was remarkable to see, and yet more remarkable that it didn&rsquo;t happen more often. After all, erosion is what happens in the badlands. It is the only constant. To build a road across such land seems like a Sisyphean task. No matter what was done, the ground beneath the road would eventually wash away. It was not a question of if, but how often.</p>

    <p>Stop five: We raced back to a point near the start of the loop where the Little Missouri made a horseshoe curve through a section of badlands. It was the best place to watch the sunset and we were losing light quickly. Around curve after curve, we drummed up excitement for how great the scene would be. The light was perfect, as Noah would say &ldquo;dynamic light&rdquo;. We raced past beautiful pictures, thinking better was up ahead. We parked, raced up the slope, and oh my what a setting. On the left and right, the striations of the badlands sloped up at a 60-degree angle, looking like stadium seating for the Little Mousori flowing below. Beneath us and curving to our right for a bit was a 150ft foot cliff that the river had carved; colored white down near the shoreline and a thick stripe of yellow near the top. In the middle of the horseshoe, a 1000ft by 1000ft expanse of grass with yellow and green shrubs interspersed. They say when settlers first came upon this scene the entire central area was black with bison. &ldquo;Squeezed in shoulder to shoulder there looked to be no more room, and yet still they were streaming in by the thousands down the slope.&rdquo; Back then there were 3 million bison in the United States. By the time Theodore Roosevelt was president the beasts numbered in the hundreds. Through the conservation efforts of TR and many others, they number 250,000 today; 25,000 on public lands and 225,000 in private herds. In our time in the park, we saw maybe 75 of the estimated 25,000 on public lands.</p>

    <p>As beautiful as the scene was, the sun had just dipped behind a bank of clouds on the horizon as we arrived ruining the National Geographic moment. At the highest viewpoint along the cliff, we met up with 10 or so other disappointed photographers. Set up with their $1,000+ cameras on tripods they were just standing around chatting, their fingers quivering from how many photos they&rsquo;d taken in the previous hour. Now though, they waited, hoping the clouds would part and the sun would peak through for a final shot. We joined the gaggle and immediately they made us the center of attention. They were very happy to have two interested and unknowledgeable subjects, so we got a free 30-minute lesson on photography; the different telephoto lenses, how to frame the shot into thirds, how to not overexpose a scene, how some of the best shots happen after the sun goes down and the pink hues arrive so we should stick around, and on and on. They were all 50+. This was how they enjoyed the parks. Not up for hiking or backpacking, photography was their outlet. One man had lived 56 of his 60 years in ND and was spending his retirement driving around and photographing the national parks. &ldquo;If I never go east of the Mississippi again I&rsquo;ll be okay. All the good stuff is out here west of it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Driving out of Theodore Roosevelt, Noah and I discussed which park we had liked more. &ldquo;I understand why TR came here to heal, it was so pastoral. It felt like such a friendly place to be,&rdquo; Noah remarked. &ldquo;Yeah so peaceful, imagine riding a horse over all those hills, Bison and Elk all over the place.&rdquo; Theodore Roosevelt had come out here to Medora, ND to heal after his mother and wife died on the same day back in New York when he was 25. He became a cattle ranger and an assistant sheriff. He hunted, he healed, and he gained a new perspective on life. &ldquo;If I had never gone out to ND, I would never have become President.&rdquo; &ldquo;Badlands NP was obviously stunning and better for photos, but it was such a harsh environment. I liked TR much more. It was just inherently pleasant on the eye. I could have sat there at Wind Canyon and just looked out for hours,&rdquo; Noah said. &ldquo;Yeah, Badlands was more spectacular, but I really want to come back here and spend the week, camping out and hiking around. Whereas I don't feel the need to go back to Badlands,&rdquo; I responded.</p>

    <p>I dropped Noah off at the Rapid City airport midday on Saturday after a quick morning nine. We&rsquo;d spent the previous day craning our necks to see Mt. Rushmore and doing a very picturesque hike in Custer State Park. It had been a fantastic week. We&rsquo;d both been accommodating of each other's desired itineraries, had many political and historical debates, and had gotten incredibly fortunate with the wildlife we&rsquo;d seen. No lions, tigers, or bears, but bighorn sheep, bison, feral horses, rattlesnakes, elk, deer, prairie dogs, squirrels, chipmunks, and birds, birds, birds, oh my!</p>

    <p>That said, I was somewhat glad to be back by myself. I was looking forward to putting on my audiobook and driving alone across a lonely landscape. </p>

    <h2 id='h-3' slot='h-3'>Highways and Byways</h2>
    <p>Roads were the lifeblood of my trip. I was on an interstate or U.S. highway almost entirely on my way from place to place. Most of that time consisted of setting cruise control to 80 mph and doing my best to not fall asleep as I sped across some supersized state. This was expected when I departed Boston. Distances needed to be traversed in tight time frames, so lollygagging on backroads was out of the question. What I did not expect was how much the history of our highways fascinated me, or how well their story explained the reasons for much of what I was seeing around me. So much so that when I felt the desire to put my trip on paper, I also felt like the story could not properly be told without also talking about the things floating around my head while on the road. Thus, scattered in the narrative of my trip, I will splice in topics that I found particularly relevant to my travels. Sometimes I searched out the topic, like when I downloaded a book about the National Parks before I left Boston, others presented themselves, like when I didn&rsquo;t understand why I saw tons of wind turbines in Iowa, but few in neighboring ND, SD, and NB, even though those states sat on the best wind producing land in the country. I hope by talking about them you gain the context for why I was so excited to visit Yellowstone or see the oil rigs of West Texas and thus you enjoy the book more. Either way, these are not my original thoughts, more excerpts of books I listened to while on the road, combined with subsequent research and personal experiences. For this section, most of my information comes from Big Roads by Earl Swift, a remarkably engaging book given the topic.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>In 1892 horses in New York City produced 6,000 gallons of urine and 2.5 million pounds of manure per day. With a horse for every six of the city&rsquo;s residents, the city was drowning in an equine stench. Along with the cost of feeding and keeping the horses in good health, equal to the cost of maintaining the nation&rsquo;s rail system, horses were begging to be replaced. Today there are only a few hundred horses left in the city. Long ago they were replaced by the motorized vehicle.</p>

    <p>In America, the age of the automobile starts in many ways with Carl Fischer. Born in 1874, a sixth-grade dropout, prankster, and salesman, Fischer was transformed by his visit to America&rsquo;s first auto show at Madison Square Garden. He returned to Indianapolis transfixed by mechanical buggies, sold his bicycle shop, and opened the Fisher Automobile company, the first auto dealership in the United States. To drum up sales he performed outlandish stunts: he dropped a Stoddard Dayton car from a sixth-floor downtown window and had it driven from the scene to show how sturdy it was; another time he attached a balloon to a Stoddard Dayton and flew out of town, promising to drive back from wherever he landed. Indianapolis loved it and Fisher became a local celebrity. The issue was that, no matter what he did on the sales front, American vehicles and the roads available to drive them on were woeful and far inferior to their European counterparts.</p>

    <p>At the turn of the 20th century, the most common road improvement was to grade a dirt path in an attempt to smooth out its humps and bumps. A step up was a sand and clay mixture spread over an earthen bed which drained well and packed down hard with use. Above that was a gravel road that needed constant redressing due to constantly scattering pebbles. At the top of the pecking order was Macadam: a layer cake construction of crushed rock. Macadam consisted of a bottom level of large broken stones that were passed over with a heavy roller. Smaller broken stones were spread atop and pressed again by a heavy roller. Rock dust was then sprinkled on top of all that, watered down, and rolled a third time. Under the weight of the rollers, the rocks would stitch together forming a relatively smooth and stable surface. Yet in 1909, of the country&rsquo;s 2.2 million miles of roads, only 8% had been improved in any way. During the rainy season, the unimproved dirt paths would become impassable and maroon farmers from markets for weeks at a time. The cars of the era were not much better, with hand-cranked starters, no tops, constant flat tires, and loud backfires.</p>

    <p>Fisher&rsquo;s solution was to build an auto racing track where the best cars and road materials of the day could be tested and improved. With his hometown of Indianapolis vying with Detroit as the auto capital of the nation, he figured it would be as good a place as any to build his track. Using the finest technique of the day, bituminous macadam, Fisher constructed a 2.6-mile track with perfectly banked corners. Driving legend and friend Barny Olefield remarked, &ldquo;two miles per minute can be made with no greater danger [on the curve] than on the flat.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the macadam construction, though sturdy at slow speeds, was not capable of remaining stitched together under the strain of solid rubber tires spinning at high speeds. On the first day of racing, just halfway through a 250-mile race Louis Chevrolet caught a rock through his goggles and had to be walked to the hospital. Then during the last race on the final day of the opening weekend, the front tire of the car driven by local boy Charles Merse exploded and his car went careening into the crowd, killing many. AAA threatened to boycott any future races if the track was not completely overhauled. The local coroner blamed the deaths on the inadequate track conditions. Fisher vowed a complete overhaul, and with the help of friend Arthur C. Newby repaved the entire track with 3.2 million 10 lb bricks. Thus the Brickyard was formed, and two years later in 1911 at the first Indy 500, 80,000 spectators were in attendance. The winner was Ray Harroun, who ditched his riding mechanic in favor of a rear-view mirror, the first time such a thing had been used in an automobile.</p>

    <p>Fischer, as well-known and connected as anyone in the auto business at this point, next turned his attention to a transcontinental road. Cars were flying off lots as quickly as they could be produced. Vehicle registrations were on the brink of topping 1 million in 1912, having quadrupled in four years. People loved the sense of freedom the car offered and found vehicles far more sanitary than their equine counterparts. Much cheaper too, after factoring in the cost of maintaining a carriage&rsquo;s drive train. Lacking were good roads to drive them on. Any ride into the country was an adventure requiring a four-foot plank, multiple spare tires, mechanical knowhow, and a tent if things went south. And that was when conditions were good. In the rainy season, dirt roads turned into mud, and transportation was put on hold. Fisher had little faith that government was up to the task. &ldquo;The highways of America are built chiefly of politics, whereas the proper material is crushed rock or concrete.&rdquo; He thought it was up to industry to lead the way and show what was possible. He envisioned a transcontinental highway spanning a dozen states from New York to California. Dry, smooth, safe, and not just passable, but comfortable in the rainy seasons. At a dinner in Indianapolis of 50 or so industry leaders, Fisher unveiled his plan. The highway would follow existing roads for much of its length, new construction connecting just those pieces which failed to connect, and then over time upgrades would modernize the highway to a uniform standard. Industry would provide the materials for the job, costing about $5000 per mile, and the public the muscle, with volunteers and local governments actually doing the labor. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build it before we are too old to enjoy it!&rdquo; he implored his audience.</p>

    <p>After lavish scouting trips, with western governors promising the moon and more to the passing highwaymen, the newly named Lincoln Highway was routed. Leaving New York it would follow a well-established route down to Philadelphia and across the midsections of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, to the outskirts of Chicago, before charting a new path through Cedar Rapids Iowa, Omaha Nebraska, and Cheyenne Wyoming, onto the old pony express trail through Salt Lake City, and all the way to San Francisco. On Halloween day 1913 the Lincoln was dedicated with fireworks, dances, and speeches in all the towns along the route. Over the next couple of years, these towns took pride in improving their sections of the highways. New Jersey remade its section in brick and concrete. In Illinois, thousands of adults and children voluntarily wielded picks and shovels trying to make their section the finest along the entire route. The improvements made a difference. Double the traffic passed through Ely Nevada in 1915 than the year earlier. Fish Springs Utah saw an uptick to 225 cars from 52 two years before. One driver even traveled its entire 3,389 mile length in 6 days, 10 hours, and 59 minutes.</p>

    <p>Soon imitators were everywhere. The Jefferson Davis Highway from DC to SF by way of New Orleans; The Lakes to Gulf Highway from Duluth Minnesota to Galveston Texas; Ficher&rsquo;s new project, the Dixie Highway from Chicago through Indy and Nashville, to his new development on a sandbar in Florida; and 250+ other named trails. More than 40 crossed Indiana and 64 were registered in Iowa alone. With each trail came a unique blaze design, tacked to trees, fences, and telephone poles, along its route. The Lincoln&rsquo;s for example, was red, white, and blue, with a black capital L on the white stripe. The trouble was that the trails overlapped, a single stretch of road could be co-opted by a half-dozen trails, and the telephone poles could end up looking like a bunch of help wanted posters. Thus deciphering where one blaze ended and the next began, and which blaze you were supposed to follow, was a dangerous proposition, especially when many of the trails were more branding than an improved road. They were patchwork and inconsistent, but in total, they created our nation&rsquo;s first interstate highway system. Further progress would have to wait until after The Great War.</p>

    <p>Part two of our highway story begins as Americans returned from the Great War victorious and took to the streets like never before. 1,396,892 cars were produced in 1919, the first year after the war; 1,731,435 cars two years after that. The cobweb of trail associations with their semi-improved roads wasn&rsquo;t cutting it. The call for a national grid of federal highways grew deafening. With the speedy passage of the AASHO (The American Association of State Highway Officials) bill on Nov 9, 1921, they had their answer. States would remain the source of highways plans and the federal government the enforcer of design, construction, and maintenance standards. Each state was to designate a system of roads on which all federal aid was to be spent and which did not exceed 7% of the state&rsquo;s total mileage. Additionally, each road within the system was to be labeled as either a primary or secondary road. The former being of an interstate nature; the latter connecting farms to market, small towns to one another, and other strictly local destinations. With its passage, the single most important ingredient of our modern road system came into being.</p>

    <p>At the head of its implementation stood Thomas Macdonald, an Iowan curmudgeon, who as a kid required his younger siblings to call him sir, and would go on to serve as highway chief for six consecutive presidents. Called chief by everyone, including his wife, he was a meticulous engineer who had the respect and trust of everyone in Washington. Facts, figures, and research were the backbone of the department&rsquo;s decisions under his leadership. Thus after the department sent maps to the 48 states asking for their primary and secondary road candidates, he asked a trusted young engineer Edwin W. James to lead a committee to come up with an internal model of where they thought roads should go, so the department could better judge the quality of the state&rsquo;s choices. For this task, James collected the population totals for each county from the previous census, plus four economic indicators: agricultural production, manufacturing output, mineral yield, and income from forest products. Then he calculated the percentage contribution each county made to the state&rsquo;s total population. He repeated the exercise for the four economic indicators. Averaging the numbers gave a quick and dirty gauge for a county&rsquo;s relative importance. James then shaded in each county, darker for increased importance within the state. Once finished the committee had a map with best to worst routing possibilities staring them in the face. Good routes would be darkly shaded and go through the more economically productive counties. It would also be easy to see that a state's choice was clearly erroneous if it went through lightly shaded counties. The state&rsquo;s nominations started rolling in and for the most part adhered to the federal model. In total the proposed roads would stretch 168,881 miles and reach 90% of the nation&rsquo;s population, with not one or two transcontinental routes but dozens.</p>

    <p>Next up was the naming of the new roads. At a joint meeting of state and local highwaymen led by Macdonald, four pillars of road design were hammered out. First, it was quickly agreed to number the nation's roads rather than naming them and to choose the routes to be included before applying the numbering. Second, Frank Rodgers of Michigan doodled a shield, like the one that adorns the $1 bill, and passed it to Edwin W. James, who added a small US over a large route number and the name of the state above the shield&rsquo;s crown. The design was approved on the spot as the marker that would identify all the routes included on the numbered system. Third, the men formally adopted the red, yellow, green, stoplight sequence, and the octagonal stop sign, painted black on yellow at the time because a durable red paint was not available until the mid-50s. The actual numbering of the system was delegated to a committee chaired by James to decide. AB Fletcher, a former California highway chief, came to James proposing the grandest highway of them all, stretching from the top of Maine down to the southern tip of Florida in Key West, with the fitting name of highway 1. Thinking about it James wondered where 2, 5, 10, and 50 would be laid. A pattern suggested itself, &ldquo;It stares one in the face, it is so simple and adjustable.&rdquo; He would assign even numbers to all the east-west highways and odd numbers to all those running north-south. The numbering would be lowest in both directions in the northeast corner of the country at Maine&rsquo;s border with Canada and would climb as one moved south and west. One or two-digit numbers would denote principal highways, with three-digit numbers signaling a spur or variant of a main route. To bring more order, the major transcontinental routes going east-west would have numbers ending in 0 and the most important north-south highways would have numbers ending in 1. Thus with Route 2 running east-west in the northernmost climbs and Route 98 running deep in the south, route 50 was almost guaranteed to run like a belt across the country&rsquo;s middle. Likewise, the intersection of routes 21 and 60 would indicate you were towards the east and just a little south of center. Unfortunately, when the agriculture secretary signed off on the plan, there were scores of complaints from trail associations about their assigned numbering or lack of inclusion and from states about their lack of major routes. The most serious complaint came from Kentucky Governor William J. Fields, who pointed out that route 60 did not run from the east coast to the west as one might predict, but from Chicago on a long arching route through St. Louis, Tulsa, and Albuquerque to Los Angeles. US 50 missed Kentucky to the north and US 70 missed it to the south, so US 60 in theory should go through his very important state. With a contingent of his state&rsquo;s congressmen, Fields took his case to the chief. Macdonald was won over by Fields&rsquo; use of logic to point out the flaws in the map. The route from Newport News VA to Springfield MO, running through Kentucky would now be named US 60 and the Chicago to LA route renamed route 66. Thus the historic Route 66 was born! That was not the only anomaly in the numbering though. Highways braided, sometimes in their proper sequence, but other times not at all. US 11 for instance curved so much at its southern end that it ended west of route 49. The Lincoln, the nation&rsquo;s first mother road, became route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming, before turning into a half dozen other numbers towards its end.</p>

    <p>The very next year after the AASHO bill&rsquo;s passage, 10,000+ miles of federal-aid highways were built, with Motor Life Magazine saying of Macdonald, &ldquo;At his nod, millions move from the US Treasury. Neither Morgan, nor Rockefeller, nor Carnegie, ever had the spending of so much money in so short a period of time.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the automobile industry continued to boom. In 1922 Essex developed the first enclosed car, sealed off from the elements, making motoring a year-round possibility. In 1923 American factories produced 3.9 million cars and trucks with registrations topping 15 million. With all these new highways and new drivers, businesses started appearing on the roadside catering to the motorist. Lodging began simply with towns offering public campgrounds equipped with a tent site, fire ring, trash can, and parking spot. For-profit campgrounds then sprang up boosting offerings such as little cabins for those not inclined to tents. The idea took hold and roadside cabin camps were available coast to coast. Some went as far as offering Simmens or BeautyRest beds and dropping cabin from their name in favor of motor court or motel.</p>

    <p>These new roads were not just a new toy for the weekend joy ride though, they were fundamentally changing the appearance of their surroundings. When personal speed had topped out at a horse's trot, cities tended to be compact and mostly circular in shape. The invention of commuter rail allowed workers to live along the rail lines; resulting in development like the spokes of a wheel as the train lines radiated out from the city center. The advent of the car filled in the in-between places and then began to grow outwards.</p>

    <p>It did not take long for the new US highways, built right through the center of towns, to start clogging up with the incredible influx of new vehicles. As they did, the bypass movement began. The theory went that by building a route around the city much of the traffic would be diverted around the clogged core. Unfortunately, it would be discovered that most of traffic was intra-city with a very small contribution being made by through travelers. Journeys of less than 30 miles accounted for 88% of all trips, and those of greater than 500 miles accounted for <.1%. The bypass failed in another way as well. With cities sprawling outward a new bypass would in 5 years be gobbled up by the city. Businesses would sprout up on its edges and a new bypass would need to be built even farther out.</p>

    <p>By the 1940s people came to see that the US highway system, and subsequent bypasses, were not the solution to all their congestion troubles. As Benton Mackay, the father of the Appalachian Trail, said of the US highways, &ldquo;the flanks are crowded with food stands, souvenir shops, and billboards, each an eyesore, and parking lots and driveways a potential hazard&#8230;.A break from America&rsquo;s equine past required a highway completely free from horses, carriages, pedestrians, towns, and grade crossings. A highway built for the motorist and kept free from encroachment except for the filling stations and restaurants needed for his convenience.&rdquo; He was asking for a grade-separated, limited access highway with all the fluff removed from its sides.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Little did Mackey know but a plan for such a system was already underway. In 1938 Macdonald got called to a meeting with FDR in the White House where the president drew six blue lines, three vertically from north to south, and three horizontally from coast to coast. He was intrigued by the idea of building such roads and asked the chief to look into the matter and report back.</p>

    <p>A few weeks later Macdonald received a similar request from Congress to report on the feasibility of such transcontinental routes. Titled, Toll Roads and Free Roads, the report was split into two parts, on the feasibility of transcontinental toll roads, and an alternative conceived of by the bureau. In summary, it said that the six transcontinental routes were buildable sure enough, but that they would not address the country's true highway needs, nor recover their costs in tolls. The cost of such a system would be $184 million per year through 1960, but by the most optimistic estimate, they would recover only $72.4 million in tolls each year. Even the NJ to CT section, the busiest in the system, would fail to break even. Plus coast to coast traffic amounted to only 300 cars per day. Only 800 cars traveled to the west coast from any location east of the Mississippi. Such demand did not justify a huge public outlay. Macdonald thought that an overbuilt road was every bit as shameful as a deficient one. Unless it was justified economically, it failed, regardless of its engineering.</p>

    <p>Part two of the report, the alternative, suggested a 26,700-mile system of free highways. It turned out to be the blueprint for the modern interstate highway system. Its mileage would be twice that of FDR&rsquo;s six transcontinental routes with most of its legs, not superhighways but two-laners, no more and no less than their usage demanded. The second part of the report also went out of its way to emphasize the need for urban highways. Congestion wasn&rsquo;t caused by thru-traffic mixing with local, it was caused by a multitude of small movements by locals. For example, of the 20,500 vehicles entering DC each day, only 2,269 or 11% were by-passable. The answer wasn&rsquo;t to bend a highway around a city but to drill it right through its middle. As for tolls, they had no place on these or any road. Roads were a birthright akin to public schooling. Plus tolls saddled engineers with a no-win situation; to attract users the toll road had to offer a better product than parallel free roads, which limited the possible improvements to those free roads no matter how badly needed they were. Alternatively, improve the free roads too much and your toll road would lose too many customers and require state subsidy.</p>

    <p>Looking past the war, FDR saw the need for re-incorporating millions of fighting men back into the labor market and retooling the country&rsquo;s high revving war industries once the fighting stopped. Thus in 1943, he sent an updated draft of the report to Congress, urging prompt action to facilitate the acquisition of land, the drawing of plans, and the preliminary work which must precede actual construction. It received a warm reception on the hill and in 1944 Congress incorporated the proposal into the annual highway bill with little fanfare. It went &ldquo;There shall be designed within the continental United States a national system of interstate highways, and which specified such a system should not top 40,000 miles in length and should be so located to connect by routes direct as practicable the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers to serve the national defense and to connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the Republic of Mexico.&rdquo; The bill also specified a quarter of each year&rsquo;s appropriation could go towards building urban highways. Unfortunately, the bill provided no special financing for the system or a timeline of when construction would begin. Yet it was still a major step. It committed the interstates to paper, now all that was needed was to find the money to build them.</p>

    <p>Years passed and the need for the new Interstates only grew. Population numbers exploded. New Orleans doubled in size in the &rsquo;40s. SF multiplied 2.5 times its pre-war size. And more cars than ever were getting pumped onto the nation&rsquo;s roads. In 1949 three fourths of all the cars on the planet were located in the US. New York alone thought it would cost $1 billion to restore its roads to the efficiency they enjoyed in 1930.</p>

    <p>The theory goes that Dwight D. Eisenhower was inspired to build the Interstate system by two trips he took earlier in his career which showed him the necessity of good roads. The first was in 1919, when as a young officer he took part in a military caravan to the west coast along the Lincoln Highway that was felled by every type of misfortune a road trip back then was liable to, due to the inconsistency of road conditions. The second was advancing across the impeccably built German autobahns on the Allies&rsquo; march to Berlin. Wrong. The interstates were a done deal in every major aspect except for financing by the time he entered politics. On the day when FDR called the Chief to his office and drew those six blue lines, Eisenhower was serving in the Philippines as chief of staff to Douglas Macarthur. When FDR submitted the highway report to Congress Ike was just taking command of allied forces in Europe. When the system received its first paltry $25 million allocation Ike was the head of the West&rsquo;s cold war alliance. In fact, by the time Ike took office in 1953, the system had been in existence for 8 years. Nevertheless, as I drove on I-90 west out of Buffalo with the sparkling water of the Erie on my right, it was Eisenhower&rsquo;s name on the little blue sign which adorned the shoulder of the road. That is because, with some encouragement from Ike, Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, funding the system Macdonald and Fairbank had put on paper 18 years earlier. The bill stipulated 90% federal financing of a 40,000-mile Interstate system, to be built over the next 13 years. The money would come from new taxes on tires and gasoline, which would be put into a new Highway Trust Fund to be used only for highways.</p>

    <p>The bureau, with a new head engineer Frank Turner, a soft-spoken bus-riding Macdonald protege who had proven himself on the Alaska Highway and by helping rebuild the Philippines after WWII, had been busy in the intervening years testing the best materials and designs for the new system. For signage they hired a corps of engineers to drive around a parking lot at night peering at signs containing six words, balk, farm, navy, stop, zone, and duck, in different combinations of typeface and spacing. Green, blue, and black signs were also tried. Nearly 6 in 10 favored a green background, up and down lettering was preferred to all caps, and as spacing between letters increased so did the distance at which people could read them. To determine the proper road material, six test loops were built of varying paving material and thickness, 836 sections in all, on which army transport soldiers would drive 126 trucks around in circles for 19 hours per day for 2 years. By the end, the soldiers had racked up 17 million miles. The conclusion, the thicker the pavement and subgrade, the better. Since the numbering system of the US Highways had worked so well, it was recycled with a few minor alterations to the new Interstate system. To avoid confusion of overlapping numbers between the two systems it was proposed that no state would have an Interstate and US highway with the same number within its borders. To accommodate this, the Interstates would be lowest in the south and west and highest at Maine&rsquo;s border with Canada. Plus, they would ditch naming roads I-50 and I-60 to avoid overlap across the country&rsquo;s middle. Additionally, the major north-south routes would now end in 5 instead of 1. So if you were at the intersection of I-10 and I-5, it meant you were in the south-westernmost part of the states. It also meant that for a road like I-90, which most Bostonians think starts at their city&rsquo;s airport, actually starts all the way west in Seattle, and terminates at Logan.</p>

    <p>Designed, tested, and now finally financed, the largest public works project in history was underway. Billions started to flow from the government&rsquo;s purse strings, each billion creating 48,000 full-time jobs for a year, consuming 16 barrels of cement, 1 billion pounds of steel, 18 million pounds of explosives, 123 million gallons of petroleum products, 152 billion pounds of aggregate, and enough earth to bury NJ knee-deep.</p>

    <p>By 1962 about 12,500 miles or 30% of the system was open to traffic and another 34 miles were opening every week. They were fast, safe, and Americans fell in love with them. They loved the act itself, the feeling of the engine under their control. Americans did not have an automotive life foisted upon them. They did not buy homes far from work or forsake mass transit or pave over their cities because they were manipulated into doing so. They wanted roads, they wanted the Interstates, and they wanted them pronto.</p>

    <p>Just as with the US Highways, the changes brought by the new roads affected life far off from its paved borders. Small towns bypassed by the interstates found their livelihoods vanish. A gas station on US 80 lost 80% of its customers when I-20 was built. A motel on historic Route 66 in Qualpo Oklahoma bought a few years before for $28,000 went on the market for $5,000 and found no takers. Manufacturing departed cities for cheap, abundant land near the Interstates, which provided them with a ready distribution network. Chrysler credited the proximity of I-90 for building an $850 billion factory in tiny Belvadere Illinois and I-44 for its construction of an assembly plant in the Ozarks of Missouri. Led by jobs and the desire for a house and a yard, the suburbs boomed. No longer able to locate themselves on the road&rsquo;s shoulder, housing and shopping developments migrated to exits and radiated out from there; nucleated development it would come to be called. With people and manufacturing jobs leaving, the central business districts of cities began to fall apart. Mass transit withered in the new environment, with low-density developments out in the suburbs and jobs spread out all over the place, there were not enough common destinations to make fixed rail lines viable. The only form of transportation suited to this new urban sprawl was the very agent of its change, the car. Thus, in a sick twist of logic, highwaymen believed that only more and bigger highways could entice suburbanites to make the trek back into the city center and thus avoid a complete abandonment of downtown.</p>

    <p>The experience of driving changed as well. Everything sped up. Restaurants began popping up at exits catering to road warriors in a hurry. They used shorthands, a logo, a color, or a certain shape of the roof to signal their presence. They aimed to provide the driver with a predictable experience, such that a traveler might ask themselves, &ldquo;should I search out a hit or miss local spot that could cost me an hour or should I grab a decent Mcdonalds burger at a great price and be back on my way in 10 minutes flat?&rdquo; The latter option often won out, which is why today the look and feel of Interstate exits with their identical chain restaurants have more in common with one another than they do with the state or locale they are in.</p>

    <p>Not everybody was overjoyed with these changes. SF had a vision of connecting the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge with a looping freeway along the peninsula's watery edge. What they got was a 57ft tall double-decker expressway passing right in front of the Ferry Building and blocking the city&rsquo;s residents from their historic waterway. The uproar of displeasure was so intense that on Jan 27, 1959, the Board of Supervisors approved a resolution opposing 7 of the 10 freeways planned for the city. Louis Mumford, the visionary social critique, found his way into the hearts of urban planners everywhere with his scathing critiques of the Interstates. &ldquo;The experts have innocent notions that the problem can be solved by increasing the capacity of the existing traffic routes, or multiplying the number of ways getting in and out of town, or providing more parking spaces for cars. Roads in NYC were designed for a city of four-story buildings. Now in effect, we have piled three NYCs on top of one another. The roadway and sidewalks flanking them should, if they are kept at the original ratio, be 200 ft wide, the current width of a NYC block.&rdquo; He went on, &ldquo;Want to save the cities? Forget about the motor car, the solution laid in restoring a human scale to urban life, in making it possible for the pedestrian to exist. A choice was looming, for either the motor car will drive us all out of the cities, or the cities will have to drive out the motor car.&rdquo; The most surprising critic of the new urban highways, though, was the man who spurred their financing. In 1959, on a drive outside Washington to Camp David, Ike&rsquo;s limo bogged down in traffic due to the construction of a new Interstate. Riled, Ike demanded an explanation, for this was far too close to Washington to comply with Eisenhower&rsquo;s notion of a largely rural intercity Interstate system. An examination of congressional intent ensued, but it concluded that every study on which the program had been based was explicit, the country&rsquo;s highway needs were sharpest in the cities; Congress had read those studies, Congress had seen the proposed routes drawn out on a map, Congress had wanted urban routes. Eisenhower's displeasure with his own system would have to remain just that.</p>

    <p>The collective acrimony over the damage of urban Interstates pushed Congress in 1968 to require two hearings on federal-aid highways. The first, a corridor hearing, at which taxpayers could speak their minds on a highway&rsquo;s location. The second, a design hearing, at which they would have the opportunity to affect the project&rsquo;s size and style. In addition, from then on, anyone unhappy with a state highway commission&rsquo;s decision could appeal the matter directly to the feds on any one of 21 grounds: these included, the state had failed to weigh neighborhood character, property values, natural or historic landmarks, conservation, or the displacement of households or businesses. The grounds for appeal were so commonplace that every remaining interstate project was almost sure to be challenged, and left in a perpetual state of appeals.</p>

    <p>This marked the beginning of the end for highway building in America. Some of the more difficult portions of the interstate system dragged on for years, but for the most part, the roads then are the roads now. The highway program had been bigger than the space program or atomic energy and had delivered on much of its promise. 70mph on the flat was attainable year around, and the fatality rate on American roads was just 2.52 per million miles driven, down from 16 per million miles driven in 1929. The cost to uproot people and pave over livelihoods became too high to build anymore though. As time went by, those cities, where the need for highways had been greatest, began calling for public transportation. People saw how the car had gutted many downtowns, leaving them ghostly quiet in the post-work darkness. Instead, they wanted a return of the tangled, creative, feverish energy only a pedestrian-focused metropolis could provide.</p>

    <p>In 1982 they were successful in splitting the Highway Trust Fund in two with the new part designated for mass transit. Congress also authorized states to scrap existing federal aid highway plans and transfer the money to a mass transit project if they wanted to; thus states would no longer have to turn down federal aid if they did not want to build yet another highway.</p>

    <p>Highwaymen, for their part, could not understand why they were becoming so maligned. Sure a few urban routes necessitated serious upheaval, but as a whole, the interstate system had been built quickly, efficiently, and provided a massive boon to the communities it passed through. Turner viewed highways as windfalls if you counted the amount of time they saved the taxpayer, the lives they spared, and the goods they carried. They were the only government activity that repaid the taxpayer with interest, and they more than compensated for whatever damage they caused.</p>

    <p>Turner was no foe of mass transit either, in fact, he often spoke keenly of the need for it; of how no one mode of transportation could answer all of a city&rsquo;s needs. In fact, he was downright bullish on the idea, as long as it was provided by the bus, a form of transportation he had commuted on for much of his career. He firmly believed rail base transit would not and could not attract enough riders to justify the fortune it would cost to build, partly because it could not be adapted to changing travel patterns. Cities had changed since the days of the streetcar, they were now spread too far and wide for fixed rail to take many people from where they were to where they wanted to go. Buses on the other hand made excellent sense. 50 or 60 could move as many people as 3,000 cars, provide almost door-to-door service, and follow routes that could be adjusted as needed. Plus, they piggybacked on an investment already in place, roads, thus requiring no costly new infrastructure. Like all of his views, his opinion on the bus was supported by research, by statistics. He could cite a 1962 study that found buses and subways moved people for about the same cost, 3.2 cents per person per mile, but that buses were far cheaper to put into service. He acted on his beliefs and in 1969 helped launch an experiment in the DC suburbs, reversible lanes in the median of 1-95 set up for buses alone. When the Washington Post staged a race between a car and bus making the same 11-mile commute, the bus won by 32 minutes. Soon commuters by bus outnumbered their traffic-jammed colleagues. Transit officials had to quadruple the bus fleet in order to keep up with demand. In the end, the experiment trimmed the highway&rsquo;s daily load by an estimated 3,140 vehicles per day.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Buses are the answer, the only answer,&rdquo; Turner said. He could not fathom why environmentalists, the press, and the anti-highway activists didn&rsquo;t embrace the bus, or why they were so smitten with rail-based transit. &ldquo;The infinite combinations of routings and schedules required by today's urban citizenry dictates that any transportation system must provide flexibility of route, destination, and schedule. That&rsquo;s why fixed route systems, which are basically spoke lines connected to a downtown hub, have such a hard time financing themselves in the fair box. And if they cannot support themselves in the fair box then isn't this a good warning that they may be failing to provide that service which the customer wants?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His favorite whipping boy became the DC metro, a system covering 98 miles at a cost of $3 billion; an amount roughly equal to the capital region&rsquo;s expenditure on roads since the founding of the nation, and about $4,000 for every household. &ldquo;What a huge capital expenditure to provide for the movement of about 5% of the transportation load within DC&rsquo;s metropolitan area,&rdquo; Turner quipped. &ldquo;Just the annual interest on the debt would buy about 5,000 new buses every New Year&rsquo;s morning for the whole life of the metro.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Personally, I do not have the knowledge to debate the merits and drawbacks of the urban Interstates. Growing up in New York City I saw how valuable the subway and buses were to the millions of people who took them every day. I either walked or took public transit every day to school and enjoyed the eclectic creatures I&rsquo;d see every day. On the flip side, I have also seen how Interstates like the Cross Bronx ( I-95 ), the Deegan ( I-87 ), and the LIE ( I-495 ) are packed every single day with commuters, delivery trucks, and buses. Without them and the Robert Moses parkways it would be a nightmare moving into and out of the city at any time of the day. Were they worth the destruction of East Tremont and the countless other neighborhoods they drill through, I am not anywhere close to being able to judge.</p>

    <p>The rural interstates on the other hand have been an unquestionable success. They save lives, time, and open up opportunities for millions of businesses and travelers. Maybe Fisher was right about the politics of his time being inept, but in my opinion, the Interstates and the US highways are an example of government at its best; building something that everybody wants, but no person, business, or state, can build themselves.</p>

    <p>That near-universal experience of learning a word and then seeing it everywhere, happened to me all the time with the information learned by listening to Big Roads. I now spotted sets of old abandoned cabins by the side of US highways. I saw urban sprawl morph into nucleated development into empty pasture the farther out of town I went. I appreciated the desire for the Interstates when strip malls on the shoulders of US highways made the roadway clogged and dangerous. I now understood what direction roads were headed just from parsing the road number and its prefix. My imagination went wild driving across Utah picturing drivers getting bogged down in thigh high dust in this very terrain when on the old Lincoln Highway. Listening to this book was like being given the prism through which America&rsquo;s physical development makes sense. </p>

    <h2 id='h-4' slot='h-4'>Colorado</h2>
    <p>As the old man back on Lee St warned, I was expecting Nebraska to be mind-numbingly boring; Mile after mile of endless grassland as far as the eye could see. It was exactly that. All the way to the horizon in every direction, nothing but mono-color golden grass. But I absolutely loved it! Its immensity was mind-warping. Rather than being flat there were rolling hills, huge swales, and elevated mesas. There were times when I'd crest a slope and have a view of flowing grass for miles in every direction. These were the great plains. No farming, no cattle grazing, no trees or bushes, no windmills capturing the howling wind, grass was all there was. Nebraska was like rooting for an underdog that wins. The beauty of the scenery was a complete surprise and I fell for it all the more because of it. For the next couple of days, all I wanted to talk about was how much I loved driving through Nebraska.</p>

    <p>South Dakota to Nebraska to Colorado, the six-hour drive felt like nothing. I made great time, beating Madison and Charlotte to our dinner spot in Boulder. I walked around its very crunchy main street; Patagonia, North Face, REI, and all the other outdoorsy stores concentrated on a four-block stretch. Madison and Char surprised me as I was walking out of Patagonia, we hugged, happy to see each other, ate quickly, transferred my camping stuff into Charlotte&rsquo;s car, and headed off into the mountains. I had proposed the idea of camping out Saturday night and hiking Sunday and they jumped at the idea. The forecast didn't look good but we were gungho. Campgrounds in Rocky Mountain National Park were closed this late in the season, but camping in the National Forests is always permitted. Winding our way into the mountains at 25mph we made our way to Arapaho National Forest, me terribly nauseous in the back seat. One hour later we had our spot picked out, and usedCharlotte&rsquo;s car lights to illuminate the ground as we set up the tent. Too tired to put up both tents, we all piled like sardines into Madison&rsquo;s two-person tent. We joked and laughed and talked about their recent moves from Boston out to Denver, and stayed up way too late as the sunrise would wake us up by 7. In the morning I looked up to see a thick coating of powder on the rain cover, four inches of snow having fallen during the night, and two girls on either side of me naked in their sleeping bags having overheated during the night in the cramped quarters.</p>

    <p>It was cold. 18 degrees with a blustery wind. At the trailhead the wind was blowing so hard it was difficult to open the car doors; the snow swirling outside looked like dust after a helicopter departs, defying gravity and flying upwards. Lacking my winter coats, I put on multiple layers of shirts under my sweatshirt. I was frozen within the first 30 seconds. Fortunately, the girls were too, and we made it only half a mile up the trail before turning around.</p>

    <p>We tumbled back into the car and drove down hoping the weather was better at a lower elevation. Sure enough, it was 53 degrees with that same howling wind down at Mt. Sanitas just outside Boulder. We had a lovely hike, with great views of the Flatirons, Boulder, and Denver off in the distance.</p>

    <p>That is something I would come to learn about Denver. It was surprisingly warm in the city, but just an hour away a winter wonderland awaited. In December and January the average temperature was 47 degrees in Denver, yet some of the best skiing in the world was right next door.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>It seems like everyone who goes vegan has a reason for it. It would be quite unusual for an omnivore in a bountiful land to just happen upon no meat, no dairy. Madison and her roommate Julia are for environmental reasons. Charlotte is vegan most of the time for a combination of environmental reasons and peer pressure, but charmingly scarfs fish down when the timing is right.</p>

    <p>At that first meal in Boulder, Madison and Charlotte were discussing sharing a few vegan dishes which sounded good, so I decided then and there that veganism would be a fun experiment for the week. Beet salad, roasted brussels sprouts, tempeh with sweet potato puree and roasted chickpeas, greeted us that first night. I kept with it meal after meal, all week. Seitan Buffalo wings, quinoa bowl, vegan hummus plate with baba ganoush, impossible burger, fried cauliflower chicken, mac and &lsquo;cheese&rsquo;, and to top it off, carrot dogs - a boiled carrot inside a whole wheat bun with all the fixings.</p>

    <p>It added some intrigue to an otherwise subdued visit. I was back at work, working 8-4 and a bit exhausted from the week in the Dakotas. I was totally happy to go with the flow, hang around, and eat. We prepared for their upcoming Halloween party, showed up to trivia late and drank at a nearby brewery instead, but mostly we ate. It was fun being part of the gang when we were ordering, rather than being the lone meat eater. I even enjoyed the food, at least most of it. I couldn&rsquo;t get behind the fake meat. A well prepared quinoa bowl or beet salad and I was all over it. Vegetables and fruits are super tasty. Fruits after all are evolutionarily designed to taste good. But the seitan buffalo wings had a rubbery texture that made them look and taste like the moon food you might buy as a souvenir at the Air and Space Museum. And the whole plant-based burgers make no sense to me. Talk about processed food! They have 40+ ingredients.</p>

    <p>That said, after a week of being vegan I could feel myself bumping up against the limitations. So it made sense when Julia said &ldquo;after a while of being vegan you are looking for something different, and so people like the variety of fake meat.&rdquo; From a business perspective that definitely seemed true. We went to some vegan-only restaurants, which Denver has many of, and they were all packed with fake meat enthusiasts.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p> Besides all the baby calves and chickens who were spared, the most important event of the week was the arrival of my bag with all my winter jackets. Back in Buffalo, I had called Travis the morning after discovering the disappearance and asked him to put up some MISSING posters. He said yes, but was not particularly punctual about putting them up. He presumed it was a lost cause so he enjoyed his weekend before putting up some posters on Lee St. Sunday evening.</p>

    <p>I was overjoyed when I woke up at that Super 8 motel in South Bend Indiana, trudged, eyes all but closed, to spoon cereal into my mouth, and got a call from a resident of 12 Lee St. who said the bag was on their porch downstairs. Throughout the five hour drive to Cedar Rapids I got texts from three other people! saying that the bag was safely on the porch. Jeremy, an energy trader, who works three or four 12 hour shifts per week, had the day off and was enthusiastic about helping. He walked over to Lee, picked up the bag, and transported it over to the Cambridge Post Office to ship it to Madison&rsquo;s House. $64.67 ground shipping to Denver and it was expected to arrive on the Monday of my visit.</p>

    <p>It was late. Day after day I wore the same sweatshirt, worrying about the sub-zero temperatures in the forecast for Jackson Wyoming. Monday passed. Tuesday passed. I was leaving Thursday after work. Wednesday afternoon around 5pm Christmas came early! </p>

    <h2 id='h-5' slot='h-5'> Wyoming </h2>
    <p>America&rsquo;s Least Value Inn. $64.99 per night but ripped comforters, harsh lighting, and inept wifi included. Having work starting at 8:10 am and the room already purchased I googled cafes in Rawlins, Wyoming. However, the closest internet cafe was Starbucks two hours north in Lander Wyoming. Thus I planned to get on the road by 6. If I was late and needed to take my morning call from the road no one would be any the wiser as long as I was online by 8:30 am, 10:30 am eastern. I executed the departure, leaving a little before 6 am, and progress was good until the sun started peeking over the horizon. It would have been criminal not to stop and try to capture the scene. Grasslands spreading to the distant mountains, the sun poking through some wispy clouds creating texture and variance to the glow. I&rsquo;d make a stop, thinking it would be my last stop, but 15 minutes later the scene improved enough to demand another photo. 7:30 am rolls around and my phone loses service 50 minutes from Lander. Not being at my computer isn&rsquo;t a disaster, but missing the meeting would create some serious side-eye, especially as this was my first week working remotely. I floored it, pushing Norman over 90mph, fear tightening my throat. Each passing minute, still no service. Hill after hill, civilization nowhere in sight, excuses flying through my head, none of them holding more than a drop of credibility. 7:40 am, 7:50 am, 8:00 am, Wyoming flying by, the beauty of the scenery now going unnoticed. 1x pops up on my screen, followed shortly by 3G. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my luck, I was still out of sight from any town, no identifiable change in location, 8:06 am on the clock. It took the phone a few seconds to start ringing but miraculously connected. So, so lucky! Then the call dropped over the next hill. 3G returned again but no matter if I stopped the call kept failing after 10 or so seconds. 15 more tries later I arrived in Lander at 8:36, the stoppages from trying to hold service causing some extra delays. Grimacing, I opened my computer. I still had no excuse. If only I had picked a better hotel I could have worked from my room! If I&rsquo;d not stopped to take those photos I could have gotten to Lander on time! If I&rsquo;d thought that I might lose service I could easily have left earlier! Now I was the 25-year-old punk who&rsquo;d been given remote work and immediately slacked off.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hi All - talking to new FX man Andrei this morning, meeting canceled. I&rsquo;ll catch up with you all later in the day.&rdquo; - Mark</p>

    <p>It was the first time the meeting had been canceled in months. Just a fun little morning scare.</p>

    <p>You come to learn that parked cars on the shoulder indicate wildlife is likely close. One car and it might be nothing or a passing dear. Five cars and you have bison, elk, or bighorn sheep. Fifteen and you have a grizzly. Driving from Lander through the Togwotee Pass en route to Jackson a hub of commotion confronted me. So many cars, it was difficult to parallel park on the shoulder of a US highway! 30 people were stationed looking over the railing. I was extremely curious to see what could be creating such a fuss. A momma and her young cub were 30 yards down the bank lounging in the early season snow. Felecia, the mamma, had been relocated here in 2016 after being deemed too close to civilization and had since made her home right there near US Highway 26, often crossing the road multiple times during her day&rsquo;s meandering. The photographers had been at this spot just as long. Following Felecia year after year, they learned her personality and her habits. In the process they had gotten to know each other too, spending day after day watching and waiting together. Now they had a new personality to learn. Pepper had been born in the den early that year and was now the size of a duffle bag. She'd had an eventful year. Separated from her mother for a month during the summer, she had been written off by researchers and onlookers. She survived off the early season grasses and the occasional small rodent. Reconnected now she looked carefree resting her head on her mother's belly. I spent an hour with them, watching their minute movements and chatting with the photographers.</p>

    <p>The photographers were positioned in a line just over the railing pointing their lenses at the two grizzlies, each sporting a telephoto lens six to eighteen inches long. Capable of taking 100 photos per second, the cameras created a machine gunfire signal to a distracted chatter like myself that it was time to look. And yet not much happened. Only once did they get up on all four legs, only to return to their reclined positions moments later. Yet each scratch or affectionate touch of mother and cub would produce squeals of delight and a ripple of shutters down the line.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sometimes Otters, or Bison, or Elk, but most days we spend up here. We are bear people. They just have so much more personality.&rdquo; Day after day, hour after hour after hour after hour, they watched the lives of these two. I got an acute thrill seeing any new animal on the trip, but to watch the same creature so intensely felt like vicarious living.</p>

    <p>With the two bears showing no signs of activity and the sun setting over the Tetons I bid farewell to my new friends and headed down the road. Variety beckoned.</p>

    <p>BEAR ATTACK!</p>

    <p>Are you prepared to avoid one?</p>

    <p>Avoid hiking alone. If a bear attacks during a surprise encounter, play dead. If the bear persistently stalks you then attacks - fight back!</p>

    <p>A nice greeting as I started my 10-mile solo hike up Death Canyon in Grand Teton National Park. If I had kept my head in the sand for the previous two days I wouldn&rsquo;t have batted an eye at this sign, thinking such sightings were so rare there was nothing to concern myself with. Instead, all I had been hearing since arriving in Wyoming was bear, bear, bear. There was the grizzly sighting on Togwotee Pass. There was Sam, my host, telling me all his bear run-ins and that I needed bear spray. There were the reviews on alltrails.com where every other reviewer claimed to have turned around on this hike because a bear was on this trail. And finally, there was this sign, whose headline at first made me think there had been a bear attack in the area recently. All told, I was spooked.</p>

    <p>I have quite the imagination, and sometimes it gets the best of me. When I was 10, my parents left the house early and I had an hour alone before I was to talk the 9 blocks to school. I started running through my options if burglars broke in. Home Alone was my favorite movie and I was playing my own version of it. Boobie traps, weapons, hiding spots, all were conjured to mind. In the bathroom? They would absolutely find me. Under the bed? Who doesn&rsquo;t look there. But oh, my closet, without a doorknob, once closed a screwdriver was needed to open it. At this point, I had convinced myself they were coming upstairs at that very moment, so I pushed my way into the overflowing closet, creating just enough space for my body, face up against the door. Then I closed the door until there was just a sliver of light shining through. They would probably open the door if it was ajar though. So I pulled on the door a tad more until it clicked closed. That's when my brain switched back on and I knew I was in trouble. I needed that same screwdriver that was in the kitchen to wedge it into the hole left by the knob to turn the latch, in order to free myself. I had also managed to leave my Motorola flip phone on the table 4 feet the other side of the door. I tried rummaging around in the pitch dark closet for something else that would turn the latch. A pencil, a rolled-up manilla folder, my finger, old soccer trophies. No luck, I was officially stuck. I started screaming, hoping the workers in the apartment above would hear and come to my rescue. I tried to break down the door, pushing against the mountain of stuff with my back I pressed against the door with my feet, bowing the door outwards. Some serious movement, but the door remained shut. Exhausted, hopeless, and crying, I fell asleep almost vertically. Upon waking up I tried breaking down the door with increased vigor; bowing out the door six inches. CRASH. The mirror on the far side of the door cracked and crashed to the floor. My father, who happened to be back at home after a morning meeting, came running in, opened the door, and found a puddle of a son. A shower later I was sent for an afternoon of school.</p>

    <p>My imagination started rolling here as well. Having tried to get to the trailhead by way of the dirt road and finding it too rutted and treacherous for Norman, I parked at the end of the paved section and walked the mile to the trailhead instead. A light snow was falling, giving the feel of winter even in late October. Temperatures were hovering around freezing as they would all week and at 6,000 feet there was already a few inches of snow on the ground. An 8-mile trail, plus the two miles for getting to and from the trailhead, and I had a full afternoon ahead. I&rsquo;d been wanting to hike and listen to my Theodore Roosevelt audiobook, but quickly thought better of that as my ears were my most perceptive sense out here.</p>

    <p>Thus chomp, chomp, chomp of my footsteps, the occasional bird and the wind were all that broke the quiet. That gave all the more territory for my mind to roam. Looking for something to occupy itself with, my mind started playing out beat attacks in my head; a surprise encounter; a grizzly stalking me and then attacking; spraying the bear spray upwind and debilitating myself instead; attacking back with a rock and winning; running downhill so that the bear would tumble over its short front arms and roll past me. Five hours gives you a long time to run through scenarios. Plus, with this early snow bears might be desperate to pack in some extra calories before hibernation.</p>

    <p>Up 800 feet, back down, and now I was entering the woods at the base of the creek. 1,500 feet up from here to the cabin which marked the turnaround spot. Dense trees loomed ahead and I gave out a little whistle to warn any would-be bears of my arrival. If a bear stalked and attacked what could I really do, so I tried to remove the possibility of a surprise encounter. I got into a routine with it; whistle, hike, peek up at the rock faces rising into the clouds on each side of the trail, whistle again. Halfway up the trail large rock slides created perfect bear dens so I added a louder whoop to my arsenal. Whistle, hike, look at the cascading stream cutting its way through the canyon, whoop loudly, repeat. The snow was falling so beautifully, each flake floating down ever so slowly. If I turned around I could see the creek trickling into a little alpine lake. I was having a lovely if frightened time. Through the woods, back and forth along the switchbacks to the base of the rock wall on the right, and up into the high meadows where the log cabin was nestled.</p>

    <p>I took a peek around the cabin, had a staring contest with a squirrel, and headed back down. It was 4:16 pm, a little less than three hours after I&rsquo;d started, and sunset was at 6:04 pm. There was no time to lollygag, light was fading fast. Ice was forming on the trail as the temperature was dropping so I slipped and slid as I hurried back down the trail. Focusing my eyes downward on my footing, I was also on the lookout for any tacks on the trail which were fresher than my uphill footprints. The snow, still falling, was providing an excellent timing mechanism for any animal tracks. About a third of the way down I almost slid into a fresh turd on the trail. It was thick and mounded much like a human&rsquo;s. In my mental state, bear poop was the only conceivable option. My reaction was to double down on my whooping and whistling, increasing the volume and frequency of both. Alone on the trail, not seeing another hiker all day, I didn&rsquo;t care how foolish I sounded. I was fully aware of how annoying I must have been though and thought to myself how fair it would be for a bear to off me just to get some peace and quiet.</p>

    <p>Another third of the way down the trail and I got distracted tracing rabbit, squirrel, and fox tracks as they darted across and down the path until a tree swayed and a growl came from the depths. I darted back up the trail 50 yards and surveyed my surroundings. Bear spray in hand and whoops spewing out, I proceeded slowly down the trail with my head on a swivel. No sign of what I had heard appeared though. Many minutes later I arrived back at Norman, just as the last whispers of light were being exhausted, 6:42 on the clock.</p>

    <p>An Idaho Hoedown was on the docket that night. Some friends Sam somewhat knew had invited us to a Halloween party at a lodge somewhere in Idaho. Sam didn't have an address. Instead, he guessed as to its location based on google satellite view. Up over the pass we drove. A flipped car on ice with a cop car beside it greeted us near the top. Sam proceeded unbothered as if that was an everyday occurrence. As we pulled into the lodge, the setting was everything that could be imagined. An old ski lodge, which had since been taken over by the school department and rented out for $100 per day on the weekends. It was in an empty part of an already sparsely populated Idaho, with a clear sky and the full Milky Way visible above. A firepit marked the center of the dancefloor, bunk beds for 30+ upstairs, bonfire outside, and a commercial kitchen with snacks. The music was turned down low just as we walked in because the costume competition was being judged. A dragon with homemade flashing wings. A dominatrix and her boyfriend who was leashed and on rollerblades, both flashed the crowd at the end of their dance routines in case that would curry favor from the judges. A man who had an entire weather system floating from an umbrella above his head. And the eventual winner, a naughty Winnie the Pooh, decked out with a homemade honeypot and skimpy booty shorts.</p>

    <p>Post awards the DJ put his large setup to full use, and all 50 people started dancing. About halfway through the evening, everything kicked up a notch when rollerblades appeared in all different sizes and we proceeded to congo line our way in circles around the lodge. We hadn&rsquo;t known what we were getting ourselves into, Sam having very little idea of what this was going to be, but it was nothing short of the most fun Halloween party I&rsquo;ve ever been to. The bonfire raged, the DJ played as loudly as he wanted, and we danced around on our roller skates until the wee hours.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Absolutely crushing news as we awoke Sunday morning, the crown jewel of the trip would be missed. Yellowstone was closing for the season the following weekend, and now the roads were closed due to the heavy snowfall received overnight. I had dreams of watching the wolves in Lamar Valley, hearing my echo in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and watching the geysers of God&rsquo;s laboratory. Yellowstone was the first stop marked down and now I would have to drive on without seeing it. A two-hour drive each way from Jackson, plus the time actually in the park, it would have been difficult to fit it in on a single weekend day, much less midweek. Plus with three of my code changes being released the upcoming week, and it being my second week working remotely, it would be poor form to take a day off. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the roads were closed indefinitely, no guarantee they would be cleared before the end of the season with a cold week in the forecast.</p>

    <p>Negative five degrees when I walked outside Tuesday morning, high of 31 for the week. I plugged away at work trying to crank these three projects out the door. Thursday rolled around, a blue bird day, and I had two of three merged in and the third just waiting for its required approvals. I logged off at 2 pm, 4 pm eastern time, drove two hours north, with hopes of seeing the major hits: Old Faithful, the Prismatic Lakes, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Hopefully some wildlife along the way and then I&rsquo;d drive back when it is totally dark around 7 pm. At least that was the plan.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Snow Tires are required on all park roads.&rdquo; A friendly park ranger informed me at the south gate.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yep, no problem. Thank you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The bluebird day in Jackson had turned into a semi-serious snowstorm at the gates of Yellowstone. The roads were a bit icy but this was my only shot at Yellowstone. Two-wheel drive and two-year-old tires be damned. I tested my brakes every once in a while and they seemed up to the task so I drove on through the low visibility snowfall. On either side of me, I saw hints of beauty; a river plunging through a 40ft canyon, Yellowstone Lake whipped with whitecaps, rolling hills speckled with conifers. But no more than 50ft of visibility was possible.</p>

    <p>Old Faithful had received its name for being the most predictable of the geysers. Park rangers were able to predict within a 90 percent likelihood the 20-minute window during which it would explode. It was 4:30 pm when I arrived with the next predicted eruption at 5:45 (+-10 minutes). Thus I drove on, up to the prismatic lakes. Billowing with steam it looked like hell was burning through the earth's crust as the gases from its noxious cauldrons floated up into this majestic winter tundra. Engulfing me with sauna thick steam the view of the prismatic lakes and their vibrant colors were almost wholly obstructed. A strong winter breeze sometimes blew away enough to catch a quick glimpse at the side of the formation. 400 degrees and miles deep, the lakes produce nutrient-rich water which spills down over the flats and down into the river below. Along the way, rich mats of microbiomes pick off the nutrients and energy from the rapidly cooling water to form orange and red streaks with the grain of the streaks going with the flow of the water.</p>

    <p>A disappointment from a color perspective, it was very cool to see the billowing smoke from all the different hot spots covering the valley as the ground and sky were covered in snow. It was especially cool seeing a few bison munching near a stream with smoke holes billowing around them, imagining the stories of Bison falling through a soft spot in the terrain and being boiled alive in the hot springs below. One of the first published accounts from Yellowstone talked about catching a fish in a cold spot and cooking it in a hot spot not more than five feet away. Here I could see how many places that would have been possible.</p>

    <p>5:35 pm and I was in position at Old Faithful. It was a bit late, at 5:53 pm water spewed 25ft up into the air and steam billowed up hundreds of feet higher. I was entertained but not fully engaged. My mind was worried about the snow and my drive home. On the 10 minute drive from the Prismatic Lakes to Old Faithful, my tires spun excessively in the snow, having trouble with traction and accelerating. Then as I was arriving at Old Faithful I tried to make a left turn into the parking lot but fishtailed out of control, ending up perpendicular to the lane I was trying to turn into. I was going only 15mph. How was I going to fare on the drive back? It would require speed to make it up the hills, but then I would have trouble staying in control coming down.</p>

    <p>When I got back to the car I got down on my hands and knees and tried to brush out all the snow-packed into the grooves of my tires. Even still driving didn&rsquo;t feel great. Then five miles back towards Jackson I was confronted with a road-closed barricade. Craig Pass and the direct path back to Jackson was closed due to the snow. SHIT. I didn&rsquo;t have my computer, there was no lodging still open in the park, and my Yellowstone App showed only one exit still open. It required driving north for 30 minutes, west out of the park into Idaho, and then down a couple of hours to Jackson. In good conditions, it was predicted to be a 3.5-hour journey. In these conditions, I was scared of going even 30mph. What choice did I have though? I had to give it a try.</p>

    <p>Gripping the steering wheel tightly, sitting up in my seat, and peering out intently for any crossing wildlife, I drove over the snowy paths of Yellowstone. Treacherous at first and then down in elevation to the dry and manageable roads of Idaho. Along the way I saw streak after streak of red. Dark in a spot and smearing out for the next ten feet or so, they signaled the untold deaths experienced at the hands of automobiles. With the greater Yellowstone ecosystem encompassing a much larger area than just the park, animals are forced to cross roads with drivers going 70mph on dark unlit roads. Tragedy was inevitable. Streak after streak, nowhere on the trip came close to the paint job of these Idaho roads; as many streaks on the road this week as the rest of my trip combined. A deer and a fox were close on this night, but both managed to elude my headlights by a couple of feet. I got pulled over at the very end of the drive going 47mph in a 35 on some abandoned Idaho highway, but other than that I emerged unscathed from quite a Thursday adventure. It was a Halloween day to remember. </p>

    <h2 id='h-6' slot='h-6'>Our National Parks</h2>

    <p>The information in this section comes primarily from The National Parks: America's Best Idea by Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan. If you have the time and inclination you really must read the full text, it has so many incredible details about our parks that I will not go into.</p>
    
    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>&ldquo;Are we the people who systematically drove a uniquely American animal like the buffalo to the brink of extinction? Or are we the people who created a uniquely American refuge for them in the world's first National Park, where they were ultimately spared from extermination? We&rsquo;ve never resolved that question, this tension at our core. We take our identity from the land in ways people of few other nations do, and yet in our predilection to make the beautiful useful we often make it ugly - or at least soiled and todrey - and nothing and nobody is redeemed in the process. We end up fouling our own nest and looking for some other last, best place in which to start the process all over again. With boundless optimism, we set out to leave our mark on the world around us, but deep down there is an uneasiness, a sadness at the heart of our exorbitant energy: perhaps the world would be better off without our mark upon it.&rdquo; - The National Parks: America's Best Idea</p>

    <p>Our National Parks have not always been there. The idea of conservation itself is but young. For the early settlers in Jamestown and Plymouth, the land needed to be tamed and cultivated in order for them to survive. Back then it was nearly a fair fight between humans and nature. Certainly, nobody worried that the depths of the wilderness might someday no longer be wild.</p>

    <p>By 1851, more than 200 years after the landing of the Mayflower, the United States was a nation of 31 states and 23 million people. Among other accomplishments, the nation had succeeded in completely fouling up its first great natural wonder, Niagara Falls. Every overlook on the American side was owned by a private citizen charging a fee for the privilege to look. &ldquo;Tourists could expect to be badgered, and oftentimes swindled, by the hucklers and self-appointed guides who swarmed the railroad depot and carriage stands. The atmosphere was closer to that of a carnival than a cathedral.&rdquo; Europeans publicly belittled Americans for letting such a majestic piece of nature become so blighted by commercial overdevelopment. To them, it was proof that the United States was still a backward uncivilized nation.</p>

    <p>On the other side of the continent in 1851, during the California Gold Rush, an armed group of white men, named the Mariposa Battalion, were in search of Native Americans intent on driving them from their homeland and onto reservations. On March 27th, 1851 they stumbled into Yosemite Valley, named as such by one of the men, Lafayette Bunnel, who mistakenly believed it meant &ldquo;full-grown grizzly bear&rdquo; when in local language it actually meant &ldquo;they are killers&rdquo;. Bunnell found himself transfixed by the vista and later wrote, &ldquo;As I looked, a peculiar exalted sensation seemed to fill my whole being, and I found my eyes in tears with emotion.&quot; With their return and the publication of Bunnell&rsquo;s book, Discovery of the Yosemite, tourists began arriving in the valley to see its beauty for themselves. However, the difficulty of the journey limited their number. A trip from San Francisco required a two-day journey by train to the nearest town and then a 2-3 day trek by foot or horseback up rocky slopes to get into the valley. By 1864 a total of 653 tourists had accomplished the trip. Yet on May 17th, 1864, with Ulysses S. Grant&rsquo;s invasion of Virginia bogged down in the wilderness campaign and Union forces averaging 2,000 wounded per day, John Connis rose in the US Senate Chamber to explain the bill he had just introduced, &ldquo;I will state to the Senate that this bill proposes to make a grant of certain premises located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the state of California, that are for all public purposes worthless, but which constitute some of the greatest wonders of the world.&rdquo; Connis&rsquo;s bill proposed to do something unprecedented in human history. Setting aside not a landscaped garden or city park, but a large tract of natural scenery for the enjoyment of everyone. More than sixty square miles of federal land, encompassing Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove of big trees, were to be transferred to the care of the state of California, on the condition that the land never be open for private ownership and instead be preserved for public use, resort, and recreation. After only a few questions and no objections, the Senate passed Connis&rsquo;s bill. A month later the house did the same, and on June 30th, 1864 Abraham Lincoln signed it into law.</p>

    <p>Six years later and a thousand miles away a band of men from Helena Montana set out in search of the place where the earth boiled like mud, to provide answers to the rumors that had been swirling about for years. The rumors began with John Colter, a former member of the Lewis and Clark expedition, who described the area first in 1807, and was laughed at by locals who jokingly started referring to it as &#96;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&#96;. A generation later, Jim Bridger, a legendary mountain man, came back with tall tales: &ldquo;It included a Lake where a man could catch a fish in one spot and then swing his line over a few feet to instantly cook his catch in a hot spring. And there was a canyon so deep that a man could shout down into it at night and be awoken by his echo in the morning.&rdquo; Credibility was hard to come by though, and a newspaper responded to an early account with a terse &ldquo;Thank you, but we do not print fiction.&rdquo; This band of respected men, which included the surveyor-general of Montana, the son of a US Senator, and a U.S. Army detachment, found the attractions of the area even more amazing than they&rsquo;d imagined. However, in their meanderings about Yellowstone Lake, the nearsighted Truman Everts became separated from the group and for the next couple of days they searched for him in vain. Then on September 13th, a surprise storm dropped two feet of snow on them. With supplies running low, they had no choice but to turn back for home, leaving notes and bits of supplies for Everts at their campsites. Upon their return, the truth of Colter&rsquo;s Hell was confirmed and the disappearance of Everts became a sensation.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I strayed out of sight and hearing of my comrades. As separations like this had frequently occurred it gave me no alarm, and I rode on in the direction which I supposed had been taken until darkness overtook me. I selected a spot for comfortable repose, picketed my horse, built a fire, and went to sleep.&rdquo; Everts thought the separation would be a momentary inconvenience, but on the second day his horse ran away, taking with it his guns, blankets, fishing tackle, and matches. Everything but the clothes on his back, a small opera glass, and two small knives. &ldquo;Then came a crushing sense of destitution. No food, no fire, no means to procure either, alone in an unexplored wilderness, 150 miles from the nearest human abode.&rdquo; He wandered for days subsisting on the bitter root of elk thistle, a small bird he caught with his hands, and a few small minnows which he ate raw, making him violently ill. He spent a night in a tree cowering from a mountain lion prowling underneath, suffered frostbite on his feet from the surprise snowstorm that blanketed the region, and found refuge for a week, huddling day and night, against the warm round of one of the thermal features. &ldquo;I was enveloped in a perpetual steam bath. At first, this was barely preferable to the storm, but I soon became accustomed to it, and before I left, though thoroughly parboiled, actually enjoyed it.&rdquo; At another hot spring, Everts broke through the thin crust above the spring and his hip was severely scalded before he could extricate himself. After a couple of weeks of wandering he managed to teach himself how to ignite a fire using his opera glass, but then one night in his sleep he jolted forward into the fire and severely burned his hands. On October 16th, 37 days after being separated, Everts was found crawling along a hillside, his starvation diet having whittled him down to a mere 50 pounds. The scalded flesh on his thigh was blackened, his frostbitten feet had been worn to the bone, and his burnt fingers were said to resemble a bird's claws. He slowly recovered though and produced a first-hand account of his ordeal, 37 Days of Peril, which Scribner's Monthly published for popular consumption. In 1972, inspired by Everts&rsquo; story and the extraordinary accounts of other explorers, Congress passed a bill setting aside 2 million acres of wilderness in parts of Wyoming and Montana as a public park, larger than the area of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. Because it was located mostly in Wyoming which was not yet a state but a territory, the new park was federal property, and thus Yellowstone became the world's first National Park.</p>

    <p>Founded but in few ways protected or cared for, Yosemite and Yellowstone were in for a turbulent couple of decades. For eight years an early concessionaire, James Mason Hutchings, refused to acknowledge that all of Yosemite Valley, including the land he claimed as his own, was public property. He continued operating his hotel and acted as the valley&rsquo;s unofficial host. Finally, in 1875 the sheriff evicted him, only for him to turn around and sue that the government had no right to designate unsold portions of the public domain for any purpose other than settlement. His suit prevailed in California, but the Supreme Court ruled against him, unintentionally establishing the park idea as constitutional. He was not Yosemite&rsquo;s only problem though. In 1889, 20 years after John Muir had first stepped into the valley he would in time call &ldquo;by far the grandest of all the special temples of all the special temples of nature I was ever permitted to enter&rdquo;, he returned to find tin cans littering the valley, meadows converted into hayfields, a plan to splash colored lights upon the waterfalls to make them more beautiful, and each night a hotel owner would create a bonfire up at Glacier Point then light sticks of dynamite to send the bonfire cascading over the ledge and down a thousand feet to the valley floor. Muir tried to escape from the attractions by heading into the high country, but to his dismay, he found much had been compromised by lumbermen and shepherds. The picture in Yellowstone was no better. Congress had not appropriated any money to manage the park, thinking concessionaire fees would cover the cost of administration. However, the panic of 1873 bankrupted The Northern Pacific Railroad with their tracks stuck in Bismarck ND. It would be another decade before they were able to complete the route to Yellowstone. Thus, without a truly viable way of getting there, only 500 people visited in each of its first four years, too few for concessionaires to have a viable business. Hunters on the other hand had a very profitable enterprise. Bison heads were selling for $1000 each in London and taxidermists in Wyoming were offering $500 for a fresh kill. The beasts had once numbered in the tens of millions, stretching out across the Great Plains, but through reckless slaughter there remained only a few hundred, all located in Yellowstone. Unfortunately, the park lived in a bit of a legal grey zone, and so punishments were light; the worst being banishment from the park. Thus, at those prices, many were willing to take the chance. In early March of 1894, Edgar Howell slipped into Yellowstone dragging across the snow a toboggan loaded with 180 pounds of supplies. He then went about methodically killing as many Bison as he could, planning to sell their heads to a Montana taxidermist. On March 13th he was captured but was none too disturbed, saying he stood to make $2000 and he could only possibly lose $26.75 in supplies. He knew he could not be further punished and just hoped he&rsquo;d be let off in time to get to Arizona for the spring sheep shearing.</p>

    <p>These affronts to the National Park ideals got the gears churning around the nation. George Bird Grinnell, founder of the Audubon Society, founder of The Boone &amp; Crockett Club with Theodore Roosevelt, and editor of Forest &amp; Stream, gave Howell&rsquo;s story prominent press, and not two months later on May 7th, 1894 a bill was passed outlawing hunting inside a National Park, enforceable with fines of up to $1000 and two years in prison. Fittingly, two months after its passage, Howell became the first man convicted under the new law, when he returned to Yellowstone in violation of his expulsion. Grinnell also teamed up with John Muir, a few years later, in a successful campaign to create Sequoia NP and an expanded Yosemite NP. The park idea was surviving, but barely.</p>

    <p>Enter Theodore Roosevelt, the young, energetic, outdoorsman. Only a few years into his accidental presidency, he asked if any law prevented him from declaring Pelican Island, which was being overrun by plume hunters, a bird reservation. Being told there wasn&rsquo;t, Roosevelt created the nation's first wildlife refuge. Three years later, in order to allow for the government to act quickly to threats against historical sites, Congress added to his powers The Antiquities Act, granting the president the exclusive right, without congressional approval, to preserve places that would be called, not National Parks, but National Monuments. The bill&rsquo;s wording was loose, also granting protections for &ldquo;other objects of historic or scientific interest&rdquo;. This additional phrase would end up making The Antiquities Act the most important conservation bill ever passed. Presidents would use it to create Grand Canyon NM, Jackson Hole NM, and 56 million acres of National Monuments in Alaska, among many others, much to congressional and local displeasure. Roosevelt used it liberally, and with it became the figurehead of the conservation movement. By the time he left office, he had created 51 Bird Sanctuaries, 4 National Game Refuges, 18 National Monuments, 100 million acres of National Forests, and 5 National Parks.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This Nation is richer in natural scenery of the first order than any other nation; but it does not know it. It possesses an empire of grandeur and beauty which it scarcely has heard of. It owns the most inspiring playgrounds and the best-equipped nature schools in the world and is serenely ignorant of the fact. In its national parks it has neglected, because it has quite overlooked, an economic asset of incalculable value.&rdquo; - Stephen P. Mather</p>

    <p>By 1914 the National Park idea had grown far beyond Yosemite and Yellowstone. Parks could now be found surrounding snow-capped Mt. Rainier, at the ancient cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, within the dark caverns of Wind Cave, in reflections of the deep blue waters of Crater Lake, and half a dozen other locations. The departments of Agriculture, Interior, and War, each claimed some responsibility for the parks, but in truth, no one was in charge. That changed in the summer of 1914 when on a visit to Sequoia and Yosemite a vacationing businessman, Stephen P. Mather, became disgusted with what he was seeing; hiking trails in the Sierra Nevadas were in poor condition, cattle could be found grazing where park rules prohibited it, and people were misusing provisions of the Federal Swamp Land Act to file private claims for choice parcels with plans to log the majestic trees. In anger, he dashed off a letter of complaint to the Secretary of the Interior, Franklin Lane, a fellow from his Alma Mater. Lane sent back a terse reply &ldquo;if you do not like the way the National Parks are being run, why don't you come down to Washington and run them yourself&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>A little while later Mather did just that, showing up in Lane&rsquo;s office to accept the offer. The founder of a multi-million dollar Borax company, at 47 he was restless for a new challenge. Years earlier, on a climb up Mt. Rainier, he had discovered that time in the great outdoors calmed his nerves and revived his prodigious energy. He subsequently joined the Sierra Club and considered meeting John Muir and listening to the old man for a few hours in Sequoia NP one of the highlights of his life. His first actions in charge were to double the pay of his assistant Horace Albreit and hire New York Publicist Robert Sterling Yard, compensating both out of his own pocket. Next, he set about increasing attendance at the parks. &ldquo;Our quandary was if we can't get anybody in because of no roads, no development, no accommodations, how can we get any money from Congress, and visa versa. More tourists meant more appropriations could be squeezed from Congress for better roads and perhaps enlargement of the park boundaries. That meant more tourists, a perfect circle.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mather and Albreit would try almost anything to accomplish this goal, approving golf courses, zoos, and even proposing Yosemite as an ideal location for the Winter Olympics. Yet on a trip to Coney Island Mathew told a friend &ldquo;this is exactly what we don't want in the National Parks. People might enjoy the carnival atmosphere, but our job in the park service is to keep the National Parks as close to what God made them as possible.&rdquo; Thus, most of their efforts revolved around building new accommodations and new roads. In each park leases were given out to build at least one grand hotel, built and operated by a concessionaire, enabling guests to stay weeks or months exploring the park. The breakthrough in visitation, however, came from Mather&rsquo;s embrace of the horseless carriage. On August 15th 1915 Mather opened up Yellowstone to a caravan of automobiles, and the National Parks never looked back. By 1917 horse-drawn carriages had been totally removed from Yellowstone as concessionaires shifted to open seated touring cars to take guests from one attraction to the next. A year later in Yosemite, tourists arriving by automobile outnumbered those arriving by train seven to one. Personally, Mather and Albreit liked nothing better than taking long trips into the backcountry, but they understood that most visitors had neither the time nor the inclination to do so. &ldquo;American tourist travel is of a swift nature. People want to keep moving and are satisfied with brief stops here or there,&rdquo; Horace Albreit said. As such the duo embarked on an ambitious plan in which each park was to have one major road that would open up that park&rsquo;s scenic wonders to the motoring public. At Glacier, they built the Going-to-the-Sun Road, carved into the mountains up and over the continental divide. In Zion, a mile-long tunnel was blasted through the sandstone, providing a better connection to Bryce Canyon and new vistas of Zion from far above the valley floor. In Yosemite, the Wawona road replaced an old wagon trail as the park&rsquo;s southern entrance. New roads, scenic turnouts, rest stops, and new maps were added, all with the motorist foremost in mind. The plan worked, as park visitation grew from 209 thousand in 1914 to 3 million in 1929. In response, Congress doubled and then redoubled the park&rsquo;s annual appropriation.</p>

    <p>While this had been happening a fight over control of the National Parks waged in Washington. Since 1900 park supporters had been arguing that the haphazard collection of National Parks needed to be brought together under a single federal agency. Yet bill after bill died in Congress due to commercial lobbying interests. Mather picked up the charge and devoted himself to the effort of creating a National Park Service. He started by cultivating publishers, editors, and writers, in an effort to get glowing features in newspapers and magazines. He followed that up with the National Parks Portfolio, a book filled with glossy photos of every National Park and every National Monument in the country. Mather boasted it was the first really representative presentation of America&rsquo;s scenery of grandeur ever published. Publishing the portfolio cost $48,000, five thousand of which Mather put up himself, and the rest he convinced western railroads to put up. Initially, 275,000 copies were printed, with special leather-bound versions going to every member of Congress. The book became a sensation, and in the first year 2.7 million copies were sold around the country. Mather&rsquo;s message was that only under a single government agency could the parks be properly promoted. Creatively packaged together they would be far more valuable to the nation than a loose collection of far-flung parks. His efforts paid off, and on August 25 1916, as Mather was high in the Sierra Nevadas, the bill creating the National Park Service was signed into law. Mather was appointed its first director, and Albreit his second in command.</p>

    <p>Trouble was always lurking in these early years though, the largest of which occurred after the passage of The Federal Water Power Act of 1920. It allowed for the construction of dams within National Parks. Proposals for dams in Sequoia NP, Glacier NP, two in the Grand Canyon, and four inside Yellowstone, soon followed. &ldquo;Once a small dam is authorized for irrigation purposes, other dams will follow. Once a small lake is raised and a small amount of timber is destroyed, once start the National Parks toward National Forest status, and it will be logically impossible to stop short,&rdquo; Mather pleaded. The memos Mather and Albright wrote to Congress informing them of their objections never got there though, as the Secretary of the Interior tore them up. Thus, when officials from the Bureau of Reclamation arrived in the Beckler region of Yellowstone, Albright resorted to bureaucratic sabotage. The first year he ordered the wooden trail bridges be taken up so that surveyors found the rivers impassable. In the second year, the bridges were intact, but for some gosh darn reason the horses they planned to use were nowhere to be found.</p>

    <p>The problems for Mather and Albright were largest, however, in the Grand Canyon. &ldquo;For more than 16 years I have been exploring and working in the Grand Canyon of Arizona on power sites. I now have the financial backing to build two huge hydroelectric plants in the Grand Canyon, to electrify every railroad, mine, and hamlet in Arizona. As a Senator I can more readily and quickly secure the concessions, right of way, etc. so necessary for the perfect development of these great enterprises,&rdquo; said Senator Ralph Henry Cameron. Since before the turn of the century Cameron had considered the Grand Canyon his own private fiefdom, running hotels, trails, and prospecting operations. In 1919 though, he lost a prolonged battle to keep the canyon from becoming a National Park, and subsequent court rulings ordered him to abandon many questionable mining claims he had used to gain effective control of particularly scenic spots. Then in 1920 he was elected to represent Arizona in the US Senate, and despite the rulings against him, Cameron refused to remove his buildings, using his newfound political power to ensure no action was taken to make him comply. Park rangers opposed to him resorted to sending their mail in code because they suspected that the canyon's postmaster, Cameron's brother-in-law, was opening their letters. When Cameron proposed two giant hydroelectric dams and a platinum mine within the park on behalf of some campaign contributors, Stephen Mather decided the senator had gone too far and set out to stop him. Behind the scenes he rallied newspapers, women's groups, and conservationists to the cause, successfully galvanizing public support, and all of Cameron's projects in the Grand Canyon were stopped. Angry and vengeful, Cameron succeeded in removing funding for the Grand Canyon from the federal budget, denounced Mather on the Senate floor, and started a federal investigation that went from park to park trying to embarrass Mather and Albright. It backfired when newspapers started their own investigation into Cameron and published how he&rsquo;d used his Senate position to further his private interests. In 1926, the voters of Arizona refused to re-elect him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The visitor would not linger long after his first comprehensive gaze at awesome scenery if the vista did not include the intimate details of those living things, the plants, the animals that live on them, and the animals that live on those animals.&rdquo; - George Melendez Wright</p>

    <p> The next era of the parks began with George Melendez Wright, a young park ranger, who believed the NPS was preserving the scenery of the National Parks but was not keeping its promise to the wildlife. Only in his mid-20s and near the bottom of the NPS career ladder, he managed to convince then NPS Director Horace M. Albright to approve a scientific study of wildlife conditions in the National Parks, funding the whole thing with his inheritance. Wright, and two colleagues whose salaries he also paid, embarked on a four-year trip surveying the western parks. Everywhere he saw the equilibrium of nature out of kilter. Coyotes, wolves, mountain lions, and badgers, were routinely trapped or shot as unwanted predators, bison were sometimes rounded up and kept in corrals like cattle, and elk, deer, and Antelope were even fed hay in wintertime. &ldquo;The unique charm of the animals in National Parks lies in their wildness, not their tameness. In their primitive struggle to survive, rather than their fat certainty of an easy living,&rdquo; Wright said. As such, when he and his colleagues published their final reports he proposed a radical new policy: unless threatened with extinction within a park, each native species should be left to carry on its existence unaided.</p>

    <p>In 1933, Wright became the first chief of the newly formed Wildlife Division of the Park Service. Under his leadership, each of the National Parks began to survey wildlife on an ongoing basis in order to identify urgent problems. Tragically, Wright&rsquo;s career was cut short in an automobile accident, at the age of 31, while on assignment for the parks.</p>

    <p>His banner was carried on by Adolph Murie, one of the young wildlife biologists Wright had hired. By the 1940s Murie had made a name for himself as a field biologist, and an iconoclast for his views of park policies that often got him in trouble with his superiors. At Olympic NP, where wolves had been hunted to extinction, he called for their re-introduction, he opposed fire suppression, preferring to let nature take its course, and he argued against the making of too many hiking trails in wilderness areas. Like Wright, he believed many assumptions about predators needed to be scientifically tested. For years Yellowstone&rsquo;s rangers had been poisoning, trapping, and shooting coyotes in the belief that it helped the big herds so enjoyed by visitors. After spending two years studying them, Murie produced a report that completely contradicted that notion. &ldquo;The problem of the big game species in Yellowstone is not one of predation, but of inadequate winter range.&rdquo; Yellowstone&rsquo;s superintendent was so upset by the report that he tried to get Murie fired.</p>

    <p>Now, as one of only three biologists in the wildlife division, Murie was dispatched to Mt. Mckinley NP in Alaska, the most remote and least visited park in the nation. There he embarked on the first-ever in-depth study of wolves. Americans had been killing wolves for centuries. Despite a park policy against the extermination of any species, wolves had been systematically eliminated at Grand Canyon NP, Crater Lake NP, Death Valley NP, Grand Teton NP, Mt. Rainier NP, Olympic NP, Rocky Mountain NP, and in 1926 at Yellowstone NP. Alaska was virtually the only place in the US where wolves still existed, a fact most Alaskans viewed with both embarrassment and alarm. &ldquo;The wolf is the master killer of all wildlife. The villain in Alaska&rsquo;s pageant of wildlife,&rdquo; the Alaskan Game Commission said. The territory&rsquo;s legislature even paid bounties of $50 for every wolf that was killed.</p>

    <p>Murie&rsquo;s arrival at Mt. Mckinley NP, coincided with the decline in the number of the park&rsquo;s distinctive doll sheep, a fact that was automatically blamed on the wolves. In that first season, Murie walked more than 1,700 miles, took photographs and home movies to augment his field notes, analyzed more than 1,000 wolf droppings to determine their eating habits, and collected 829 doll sheep skulls to study the age and health of the animals when they died. Murie would continue his study for a decade, relocating his family to a remote cabin within the park. In the end, Murie concluded that a series of hard winters was the principal cause in the decline of doll sheep and that wolves actually strengthened the sheep and caribou herds by culling out the sick and the weak. The report was denounced by hunting groups as pro-wolf propaganda, but when the sheep numbers rebounded and the furor subsided, the NPS instituted a permanent ban on wolf killing. It was the first time in history that the species had found any protection from any government agency.</p>

    <p>In 1995, 14 grey wolves from Canada arrived in Yellowstone in cages, with a long-range plan to re-establish the predators in their former habitat. Within a few years, the wolves were thriving, and the Yellowstone ecosystem was nearer equilibrium than it had been in many years. Efforts like this throughout the park system have resulted in wilder parks now than existed a century ago.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So rapid is the increase of travel to the parks that it is none too early to anticipate the time when their popularity shall threaten their primary purpose. While we are fighting for the protection of the National Park System from its enemies, we may also have to protect it from its friends.&rdquo; - Robert Sterling Yard.</p>

    <p>As predicted by Robert Sterling Yard in 1943, the day has arrived, when the future of the National Parks is endangered as much by us who love them as they are by deregulators and commercial interests. Visitation was 32 million in 1950, 168 million in 1970 , 255 million in 1990, and 327 million in 2019. &ldquo;Backcountry trails are clogging up, mountain roads are thickening with traffic, picturesque vistas are morphing into selfie-taking scrums. And in the process what is most loved about them risks being lost,&rdquo; writes the Guardian. In many ways, it is a good problem to have. America would sooner go to war than carve up Yosemite Valley into private landholdings. Yet the fact remains, in the nation where the National Park idea was born, our scenic wonders are engorged with visitors. The number of worthy parks does not scale with our increased population or enjoyment of them, they were fixed thousands of years ago by the forces of nature. Some parks are even reaching a point once thought sacrilege: limits on visitation. </p>

    <h2 id='h-7' slot='h-7'>San Francisco</h2>
    
    <p> I left Friday afternoon with 14.5 hours to San Francisco. It is a fairly straight shot from Wyoming; across to Idaho, down into Utah, and then directly southwest through Nevada and into California. It was a pretty standard drive, fast and beautiful. The golden grasslands of Wyoming and Idaho gave way to the scrubby desert of Nevada, mountains continuously rimming the horizon. I slept in Elko Nevada Friday night a small strip of a town along I-80, got pulled over for speeding within a half-mile of getting back on the highway Saturday morning, filled up at a gas station near Reno which doubled as a shockingly popular strip-mall casino, and had my breath taken away by the beauty of Tahoe.</p>

    <p>I got distracted flipping off some teenagers in a Jeep who were zigzagging through traffic. When I looked up, Tahoe Lake was visible through a V formed by two pine-covered slopes, the sun glinting off its deep blue water. It was just a peak, but it was absolutely stunning. I remember so vividly that drive down, bombing recklessly around the curves, the beauty of each sneak peek egging me to go faster.</p>

    <p>I pulled over at Logan Shoals Vista Point, about 300ft above the lake. Cinnamon trunked pine trees 150ft tall, massive granite boulders, pine cones the size of footballs, and that water!! So crystal clear it was possible to see 24ft deep. I climbed all the way down to the water's edge and out onto the last protruding rock. 65 degrees, not a cloud in the sky, the sun warming me and the rock, it was as peaceful as I have ever felt. Looking down into the water it was possible to see each and every boulder 50ft out from shore. It was a totally different experience than any body of water I&rsquo;d ever seen, so clear and almost completely still. No longer did I have to guess where the fish were, I could see every minnow, trout, and salmon, swimming in my vicinity.</p>

    <p>I sat there and I sat there, the lake nearly still. It calmed my breath and my mind. I contemplated life, how it was possible Tahoe Lake contained enough water to cover California fourteen inches deep, but mostly I just stared out in a bit of a trance. I understood why this was the coveted retreat of the rich. The dense green of shore was the only break between the deep blue of the water and the light blue of the sky. I never wanted to leave.</p>

    <p>Turning back towards land I saw boulder after boulder all the way back up to the car. The ground is LAVA!!! Only the boulders were safe. Scrambling up some, plotting my way around the sides of others, and climbing straight up and over most, I had an absolute blast. Up the 300ft climb and atop the tallest boulder staring out at the Lake, I almost walked down and did it again, it had been such a good time. I was now absolutely stoked to go outdoor climbing with Isabel&rsquo;s friend Sabina the upcoming weekend.</p>
    <img src="/long_one_pictures/tahoe.JPG"><br>
    <img src="/long_one_pictures/tahoe_water.JPG"><br>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>The rest of the way to the Bay was uneventful. I left Tahoe around 4:30 pm and arrived at Acorn&rsquo;s in El Cerrito, a suburb in East Bay around 7:30 pm on Saturday evening. Aaron Corn, thus the obvious nickname Acorn, was on the golf team with me at Tufts and was now doing Teach For America in Oakland&rsquo;s Deep East. The original plan had been to leave Boston earlier and spend a month or two at Acorn&rsquo;s. Now it had been cut down to a little more than two weeks.</p>

    <p>I was stoked to see Acorn, and him me. I dropped off my stuff, said whaddup to his roommates, and we took a little drive to get dinner. Acorn took me to his local favorite, El Mano, a Peruvian restaurant, and ordered us two Lomo Saltado&rsquo;s with chicken. Apparently a beloved Peruvian dish, it was chicken stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and soy sauce, served on a bed of jasmine rice and french fries. The french fries were an odd touch, but very tasty. Unfortunately, it turned out to be our last true meal together for my entire visit.</p>

    <p>Acorn has OCD regarding his health and my visit sadly coincided with a bad bout of it. After a round of failed antibiotics, he was worried that an infection might spread to his kidneys, a condition called Pyelonephritis. The worry combined with him feeling piss poor and the effort of having to teach rowdy sixth graders math for eight hours each day, meant Acorn was out of commission for after-work activities.</p>

    <p>I was annoyed for the first couple of days, wanting to spend time with my pal, but after I came to terms with the situation, there was no animus between us, we just did our separate things. Up at 7 for work, I would finish work by 3 and have tons of time for activities. A few days I played 9 holes at Tilden Park Golf Course, others I met up for dinner with other friends in the Bay Area, but mostly I toured the sights solo. I did a night tour of Alcatraz, saw The Irishman at The Castro, walked the Mission, Chinatown, Oakland, and Berkeley neighborhoods, and did much thrift shopping along the way.</p>

    <p>These are a few snapshots from those meanderings.</p>

    <p>At first, it looked like an abandoned storefront. The single-story building had peeling paint, markedly unclear windows, and an unbelievable clutter inside. On second inspection my eyes picked up that the bikes and bike parts. It looked like the bikes had been thrown in there until they were stacked six feet high. It reminded me of a NYC apartment closet where you open the door, stuff the latest thing in the first available spot, and shut the door in a flash so as to avoid an avalanche of stuff pouring out. It was a big storefront too, maybe 40ft by 40ft, thousands of bikes stuffed in to make an ocean of metal and rubber.</p>

    <p>As I got to the corner of the block I looked into the front door, cut on a 45-degree angle, and saw an old disheveled-looking guy in his 60s sitting on a 1970s rolling office chair acting as a gatekeeper of the clutter.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Got any bikes for sale?&rdquo; &ldquo;I got a bunch of bikes, what are you looking for?&rdquo; &ldquo;A $100 cruising bike, for riding around town.&rdquo; &ldquo;I got this one out here for $139, but we could work out a deal.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Standing laboriously, he pointed out a black mountain bike at the top of the nearest pile. Besides from an unbelievably rusty chain, the bike felt pretty solid riding around. I was thinking about buying one as a gift for Acorn, who didn&rsquo;t have one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I have my car here and don't have cash, but I&rsquo;ll come back because I like the bike.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you sure we can&rsquo;t make a deal right now? I could throw in a lock.&rdquo; Gesturing that there were plenty of locks available in the clutter.  &ldquo;Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fit it in my car, unfortunately. It&rsquo;s a small two-door. Thank you though.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Most unfortunately Acorn said he probably wouldn't ride it if I got it, so I never got to go back and haggle with the old man on the price.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:5%;border-top: 2px dotted;"><br>

    <p>Berkeley Bowl, a supermarket, is a worthy tourist attraction. The theory that our sense of beauty is tied to settings and people who hold the promise of health and fertility proved true at Berkeley Bowl. Row after row of produce of every variety greets one's eyes upon arrival. A good local supermarket has pineapple, persimmon, and turnips, the fringe produce items. Berkeley Bowl has all of those items in four or five varieties. Large &ldquo;Chestnut Hill&rdquo; Pineapples from Costa Rica, Medium &ldquo;Dole&rdquo; Pineapples from Hawaii, X-Large &ldquo;Del Monte&rdquo; Pineapples from Costa Rica, Medium &ldquo;Del Monte&rdquo; Honeyglow Pineapples from Costa Rica. A whole bank of root vegetables: celery root, purple kohlrabi, rutabagas, white lobok daikon, and every color of carrots and turnips. Dried pears, persimmons, and white peaches were some of the unusual dried goods. It was like an agricultural museum, where you can see the variety of bounty produced on this planet.</p>

    <p>The most remarkable thing about Berkeley Bowl was the feel of the place; totally homey, like your own mother had done the design and branding. With only two locations, none of the efficient management and mass appeal branding of a Whole Foods or Central Market permeates the space. I walked in a bit bemused that lists had thought a supermarket was a top sight, but I walked out a convert, educated in the possible beauty of a supermarket.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:5%;border-top: 2px dotted;"><br>

    <p> I have a rule that I can buy basically whatever I want at the supermarket, honeycrisp apples, steak, ben and jerrys, because expensive supermarket food is way cheaper than eating out. I thought that rule should apply to thrift shops as well, but the thrift shops of California pushed that rule to its limit. Maybe because there is so much wealth in the bay area, or maybe SF&rsquo;s rule banning chain stores allows for more local thrift shops to survive, I am not sure. All I know is that they are out of control good. At one thrift shop, I found basically new All Birds for $28! On my walking tours, I poked my head into each and every one just to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t missing any gems.</p>

    <p>The idea is that you will spend less in the long term by avoiding eating out or buying big-ticket clothing items, but the quality of these thrift shops was making me into a fashionista. Satiated hunger provides an upper limit on how much food I want, but at these prices and this quality my demand for clothes felt infinite. A green canvas coat with tons of pockets, a few short sleeve button-downs, those All Birds which just happened to be in my size, and a Patagonia sweatshirt all found their way into my luggage.</p>

    <p>The experiencing self and remembering self are often different people, but never have they been as bi-polar as the weekend Isabel visited me in SF. The experiencing self was a crab apple. Happy to see Isabel but very cranky with how the weekend was playing out. I was hoping for a jam-packed itinerary. However, at the behest of Isabel&rsquo;s very nice friend Sabina we were to stay at Sabina&rsquo;s and she would be our tour guide. An SF unicorn, a term meaning a kid who had actually been born and raised in SF proper, we thought Sabina would be a fantastic tour guide. And she was, but her pacing drove me crazy. The day before we would discuss big plans that required an early start, only to wake up early and laze around the house all morning. In a vacuum, they were very nice mornings. On the top floor of a three-floor townhouse in Nob Hill, we would make breakfast, chat with her housemates, and look out the window at the fog rolling by. For me, sitting by the window, looking out, it felt like detention, eyeing a world of forbidden possibilities. Isabel wasn&rsquo;t about to be rude and up and leave before Sabina was ready, thus if I wanted to get an early start on the day I would have to leave Isabel; not a nice thing to do to a person who had just flown across the country to see me. Thus I was grounded, jittery and irritable by the window as life passed on by. My blood felt like it was simmering, getting close to losing all orderly form. There I sat, imagining all the SF things I had literally driven cross country to see and was now going to miss.</p>

    <p>On top of that stew was the fact that Sabina loved Isabel so much that it often felt like I was the third wheel. Sabina would always face Isabel when she was talking and would focus the conversation towards her. At stores she made Isabel try this on or check out that, and I would be left to wander around by myself. It felt as if Sabina was nice to me, but only because Isabel cared about me. If instead, I wasn&rsquo;t around, then all the merrier because she would have more &lsquo;Bell&rsquo; time.</p>

    <p>I remember those were the active feelings during the weekend, but now I think back on some of the best experiences of the trip and how generous a host Sabina was.</p>

    <p>On Friday, Sabina and her housemates threw a party they&rsquo;d been wanting to have for a while, in honor of our visit. There we hobnobbed with civil engineers, structural engineers, and the techies which are said to be overrunning the city. It was fascinating to talk with the engineers about how the sandy soil of SF creates headaches for them as they try to build vertically, and about the new technologies going into making buildings earthquake resistant. There were also plenty of Peppermint Patty Shots to go around, and a beautiful rooftop from which you could see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the TransAmerica building.</p>

    <p>Saturday afternoon, we strolled down to the Ferry Building at the bottom of Market Street. It felt like the old capitol building, with much of the city laid out to drive focus to it. Completed in 1898, it used to be the second-largest transportation hub in the world behind London's Charing Cross Station. Peaking at 50,000 commuters per day, it was SF&rsquo;s connection to the world until the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge were completed in the 1930s. Then the automobile, the Embarcadero Freeway, and a newly built train station called the Transbay Terminal, cast the Ferry Building into disrepair. From the 1950s until its demolition in 1991, the Embarcadero Freeway, another name for Interstate-480, a double-decker highway, crossed right across the face of the Ferry Building casting it in constant shadow. It was a testament to the era of highwaymen carving up American cities, holding the automobile over everything else. Today it is a cultural hub again, that freeway replaced with a plaza where locals try to convince the tourists to buy this or that trinket, the homeless laze out in the open, and skateboarders attempt impressive jumps. The building itself was restored in 2003 with a teeming marketplace on the first floor, office space on the upper floors, and an active ferry service. The Saturday farmers market was still going on when we arrived, so we started on the right and grazed our way left; latkes with hummus, bread dipped in olive oil samples, blackberry pie, a plumeto, and a half a roasted chicken we picked apart with our hands, served as lunch. The variety of stuff from fresh produce, to ready-to-eat bites, to artisan cart iron pans, pottery, and blown glass, made walking about good fun.</p>

    <p>On Sunday we tried surfing in the Pacific. The size of the surf was below average everywhere so we headed to Ocean Beach, a spot where they sometimes host professional events, but today it had good 3ft starter waves. Parking our car in outer Sunset, a neighborhood perpetually cloaked in fog, we rented boards and wetsuits from a local surf shop. I stretched and contorted my body trying to get my rented already wet wetsuit on in the store's one changing room. I succeeded, walked out, and was told that I had put it on inside out. Back to the back of the line I went. The experience taught me that the only thing harder than getting in an already wet wetsuit, is getting back out.</p>

    <p>Properly clothed and struggling to carry our massive boards, we stepped into the frigid Pacific. It was so cold that when a wave hit all air would immediately gust out of you. Sabina, a beginner surfer but not a novice like Isabel or I, took the lead and tried to show us how to paddle out, how to crest oncoming waves, and in theory how to catch a wave. I&rsquo;m not sure how they measure waves, but these three-footers looked at least eight feet tall. Sitting atop our boards they would rise up well above our heads, crash atop us, and pummel us back to shore. At first, it was exhilarating just catching waves while lying down on our boards. Crashing just behind us, the power of the wave would shoot us on a 100ft long slide. After a few runs of that we became more ambitious, trying to get further out so we could potentially ride some of the bigger ones. After battling out a couple of hundred feet, I couldn&rsquo;t quite hear Sabina&rsquo;s explanation but she seemed to be saying to wait for the second wave of a pair because it was bigger. Freezing, battered, and drunk on seawater, none of us could quite get up on a big one. We&rsquo;d get battered trying to get out there, finally get ourselves in position, miss the angle slightly, and get flipped all around in the eventual crash. It was exhausting but also exhilarating. The cold made us feel every inch of our aliveness, and the constancy of the waves demanded our attention and determination. We kept with it for what felt like a while, but slowly our ranks began falling. Isabel hyperextended her hand while blocking the board from slamming into her head and was done. Sabina fell back shortly thereafter realizing success for us was not in the cards. Stubbornly I kept at it for one last full push all the way out there. The waves were now looking much larger than when we had started. Punished again by the second wave of a large pair, no final glory was achieved. I turned around and rode back to shore on one of those smaller waves we had once been so exhilarated by.</p>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p> Monday could have made the whole trip worth it by itself. Off we went into Napa County for a day of rock climbing and wine. On our way, we picked up Sabina&rsquo;s climbing buddy Cooper, a slightly disheveled rustically handsome man who lived on a boat in Alameda Harbor. Up north we headed, passing vineyard after vineyard, through the small towns of Napa Valley to Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. From the trailhead, we headed .5 miles to The Bear. Poking out from a distant ridge, the rock we were to climb looked like an upside-down cup, so itsy small. I was imagining a large sheer face. If that little thing could be used for serious rock climbing, potential spots are everywhere! But then as we approached the cloak of perspective was removed, leaving a 60ft boulder of volcanic rock. We climbed down off-trail to the far side of the boulder where the climbing routes were and set up shop.</p>

    <p>Isabel had basically never climbed, I had only climbed a half dozen or so times inside, Sabina was an avid intermediate, and Cooper our grizzled veteran. Cooper would go up first and lead climb, stringing the rope through carabiners he brought up with him and attached to bolts fastened to the rock by our forefathers. Cooper was tasked with this job because it involves climbing the route, stopping along the way, one hand on the wall one hand fiddling with the gear, and then properly looping the rope through. Once at the top Coop would tie off and repel down, the route set up for the rest of us to attempt.</p>

    <p>Up through the bottom loop and out through the top loop of the harness, make a figure-eight knot, count the two&rsquo;s, make sure there are five of them, &ldquo;belay?&rdquo;, &ldquo;belay ready&rdquo;, &ldquo;climbing&rdquo;, &ldquo;climb on&rdquo;, up we went. The dark grey rock had the texture of molten tortilla chips, very sharp and jagged. Not pointy enough to cut our hands, it made for fantastic holds, and Isabel and I were able to make it up the first couple of routes cleanly. It was incredible climbing outside. Compared to climbing indoors this was the difference between a hot and a cold shower. It almost felt like a wholly different experience. Climbing actual rock made it feel like a basic human skill, no longer a fabricated sport, humans invented to distract themselves. Add in the sun, wind, beautiful views, music, friends, and red wine to sip on between climbs, what could be better.</p>

    <p>Having warmed up now we moved left to try and tackle a more difficult route. The rock bulged out over here making the first part of the route overhung and thus far more challenging. Isabel and I drank wine and watched as Coop and Sabina slipped off the rock a few times 15 feet up. It looked extremely challenging trying to get over the hinge of the bulge. When they had completed the route and told us we were up, we had little faith it was going to happen for us. The route started with a series of small overhung holds before we had to swing left for a water bottle shaped rock with our left hand and then somehow navigate our way around a small shipping box sized rock sticking out at the edge of the bulge. After that, the route flattened out and it would be pretty easy to scurry up the last 25 feet. Try one, and I didn&rsquo;t even get to the third hold. Try two, I slipped off the water bottle-sized jug. Try three, I slipped off the water bottle-sized jug. Try four, I slipped off the water bottle-sized jug. Try ten, I went a slightly different route and made it up to the shipping box and slipped off. I just hung there 12 feet off the ground, exhausted, my hands aching, and my harness giving me quite the wedgie. A couple of feeble attempts later I asked to be brought down so I could take a rest. I knew the route now, I could fly through the holds out right, and understood that I needed to quickly move off the water bottle shaped hold to have the momentum to get a good hold at the top of the shipping box. Sheer persistence won the day. I was able to execute the plan perfectly, right hand getting a nice hold on the edge of the shipping box, enough to pull myself up and wrap my left hand on the other side, and skin myself up over the ledge of the box. Isabel, the legend she is, also accomplished the route. 5&rsquo; 3&rdquo; and a ball of energy she may have found her calling on the wall. She loved the experience and looked to be an absolute natural.</p>

    <p>At 4 pm, the sun starting to color our surroundings yellow, we packed up our gear, sipped the last of our wine, and merrily made our way into the valley for a late wine tasting.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all wanna go through the prescribed wine tasting or just pour you guys some good shit?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Clearly, Alli could tell by our appearance and merriness that we weren't her average Napa Valley customers. Four ragtag-looking kids, arriving 45 minutes before closing, she knew she could shoot the shit with us.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a baaad day. I real bad day. Get this, this literally happened today. My whole life I&rsquo;ve been told my great grandfather was a pitcher for the Yankees.&rdquo; Pointing to the well-worn Yankees cap on her head. &ldquo;This morning I called up my grandma and asked her for details; when he played, how good, how long. You know what she said?! &lsquo;Oh no Frank was a pitcher on the Red Sox&rsquo; My whole life I&rsquo;ve been a Yankees fan and now the fucking Red Sox! Why not the Indians or some shit? So it&rsquo;s been a bad day. Now I gotta go and buy a new hat.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She had us in stitches with basically anything she said. She had a large, voluminous, woman from Brooklyn vibe, an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking here!&rdquo; voice, and the ability to banter with anyone.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You look like the mother of the group.&rdquo; She said to Iz after a few pours. &ldquo;Like all uptight and professional.&rdquo; Not at all true, but had the three of us almost falling off our chairs in laughter.</p>

    <p>We shut the place down, sadly parted with our newfound friend, and headed to get burgers and shakes at the iconic Gott&rsquo;s Roadside. A burger joint on the main road through Napa, it has a pristine 1960&rsquo;s look; outdoor seating, neon lights, a red and white paint job, and those funky angled overhangs which just scream drive-through. We went all in, ravenous, each of us having only eaten a breakfast sandwich that morning. Shakes, fries, funky burgers, and a bottle of Zinfandel, our new favorite wine. The four of us just worked as a group, the dynamic just so fun. We just kept ordering, seconds, thirds, trying to extend this great day as long as we could.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ohhh shit. I thought my flight was at 10 pm, it's actually at 7:15,&rdquo; Isabel blurted out. Our great day was suddenly over. We scrambled to get our stuff into the trash and our bodies in the car. We had a good laugh about her being the adult in the room. But we had to roll! 5:30 now, we had a 1:12 drive to SFO. No time to stop and pick up Iz&rsquo;s suitcase at Sabina&rsquo;s. No time to drop Cooper and me off in East Bay which we would be driving through. All Isabel had were the clothes on her back, her phone, keys, wallet, and dirty clothes from climbing. Fortunately, Sabina and Iz would see each other the following weekend for a Haverford reunion. But it meant Iz would be flying back in only her flowy sundress. Sweaty from climbing she&rsquo;d decided to go commando for wine and burgers. There was no changing now. The next day she wired us to say she&rsquo;d arrived but had woken up a couple of times during the flight to see one of her boobs hanging out.</p>

    <p>Try driving a long nail into rock. It's impossible. The nail will bend in half between the force of the hammer and the unmoving rock. That is exactly what it felt like trying to get these tent spikes into Acorn&rsquo;s backyard. It had not rained in months and the ground was impenetrable.</p>

    <p>After a couple of meals with Bay Area friends, some more neighborhood exploring, and a week of work, here I was on Friday night trying to set up my mother&rsquo;s 1980&rsquo;s tent. The design was classic, an extruded triangle, it looked like the tent emoji. Three metal bars created the staple-shaped backbone of the tent. This was held in place, and thus the tent livable, by six stakes pulling the floor of the tent out as far as it could stretch. The problem was that the stakes were close to impossible to get in, and once they were in the ground had the consistency of marbles with large crumbly bits, so the tent would sway slightly in the cool bay area evening, the stakes would pull out, and the tent would collapse.</p>

    <p>I was doing this as a trial run for my weekend in Yosemite. I&rsquo;d camped in Denver but we&rsquo;d used Madison&rsquo;s tent, and with Noah we&rsquo;d been doing so much driving at night that we opted for a $42 Ramada or a $46 Motel 8 over trying to set up a tent in the windiest part of the country on a thirty-five degree night. Thus, this was my maiden voyage with the tent. My mom had used it 40 years ago when she lived in San Francisco and went camping in Yosemite. Since then it had been sitting in the closet of our NYC apartment. We had pretended to set it up before I&rsquo;d left just to make sure all the pieces were still present, but it's not like we drove stakes into the apartment&rsquo;s hardwood floors. Here I was just trying to make sure it would stand the night before having to rely on it out in the woods. Accomplishing that turned into a Sisyphean task.</p>

    <p>I moved to a couple of different places in the grass before my finagling, praying, and scolding, paid off. Two hours and 7 bent or broken stakes later I had a standing tent. With Tara, Acorn&rsquo;s girlfriend spending the night, I decided to sleep in my newly constructed masterpiece over sleeping on the couch. Cozy with my sleeping bag and sleeping pad I was amazed to wake up at 7 am the following morning with the tent canvas still above me. Test passed.</p>
    <img src="/long_one_pictures/tent.JPG"><br>

    <br><hr style="width:50%"><br>

    <p>Sprawled flat on my stomach I inched myself towards the ledge. I was absolutely petrified, not trusting my body to stand. Finally, I made it, to peer over and look 1,000 feet straight down to the valley floor. Absolutely breathtaking. Across from me the great wall of El Capitan rose, the morning sun illuminating all of its subtle colors. A waterfall on my left, one of the few still flowing this time of year, was arching over the edge of the valley wall. I was looking at what John Muir called &ldquo;by far the grandest of all the special temples of Nature I was ever permitted to enter.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Saturday morning I had risen early, packed up the tent from Acorn&rsquo;s backyard, and headed three hours west. En route I passed through very hilly wheat-colored grassland, groves of peach trees their leaves orange and red, and finally to wooded mountain slopes. I arrived at the first-come campsite around noon, filled out an orange slip with my $18, and headed to campsite 31. It came equipped with a bear box for all food, a wooden table, a fire pit, and a patch of dirt on which to set up one&rsquo;s tent. The stakes went into the packed dirt like going into buttah! And held tight! The tent was up in ten minutes, food was stowed in the bear box, and I was off for a small afternoon hike at Hetch Hetchy Valley.</p>

    <p>Asleep just after sunset at 5:45 pm Saturday evening, I was up and at &lsquo;em Sunday morning at daybreak. And yet still by the time I got to Yosemite Valley the place was a zoo. A visitor center, an art gallery, multiple campgrounds, a medical clinic, a grocery store, a chapel, and many other buildings littered the valley, looking quite unnatural in perhaps the most beautiful place in America. Then there were the cars, so many cars, and the buses which you needed to take from central parking to any of the trailheads in the valley. The valley still had moments of awe, like seeing the small cocoon tents dangling halfway up El Capitan indicating a climber had spent the night 500ft up in the air, or when Half Dome came peering over the conifers with Yosemite river trickling in the bottom third of the frame. Yet there was something off about the place. As if the amusement park atmosphere of its pre National Park days still had vestiges, with the buildings staying the same, just under the new management of the NPS rather than private purveyors.</p>

    <p>For that reason, I headed up to a trail atop the valley&rsquo;s walls to peer at its magnificence away from the hullabaloo. At least that's what I was thought. Unfortunately, Yosemite is so popular that everywhere had people. Trailhead parking was full so I had to park in the ditch a quarter mile up the road. 7.4 miles, the trail cut down to Taft Point from which I peered down to the incredible view of the valley floor, across to Glacier Point for a panoramic vista of Half Dome and the grey slopes of Clouds Rest beyond, before doubling back and finishing at Sentinel Dome for sunset on the highest point in the valley. It was a tour de force of the iconic views the park is famous for.</p>

    <p>I have been team Yellowstone since reading American Wolf, rooting for it to be the crown jewel of the National Park System, but after seeing Half Dome with Clouds Rest behind and Nevada Falls off to its right, I could understand why Yosemite held the top spot in many people's hearts. It is the greatest natural amusement park in the world. It may not have the wildlife of the Everglades or Yellowstone, the scientific importance of Carlsbad or Haleakal&#257;, or the remote wilderness of Glacier, but it had some of the best hiking and climbing in the world, waterfalls that looked as if they were computer-generated, and cliff faces made for iconic photographs. It is nature designed for human consumption, and what an enjoyable feast it is.</p>

    <p>The Thanksgiving break was long and felt too long. My father wanted to have a joint birthday party Saturday night after Thanksgiving, and with the prices of flights back it meant flying back the Wednesday afterward. Spending my birthday with my friends, Thanksgiving with the family, the joint birthday, and all the days in-between were very enjoyable. But the days afterward were just slooow. I yearned for the pace of the trip, my mind still churning at that pace, the break felt like sitting down after a hard run. Wheezing, your muscles aching, what feels best is a walk or even a slow jog. An immediate stop and you feel too small for your body, your heart pounding, all the gases and fluids pushing up against their boundaries.</p>

    <p>Sitting middle seat next to the bathroom with a seat that could not recline on the flight back across, I was excited for all the driving coming up in the next ten days. I would arrive Wednesday night, work from Acorn&rsquo;s Thursday, drive to LA Thursday night, stay with my friend Benny Ruskin for the weekend, and spend the following week driving across the southwest to Austin. I was going to be a road warrior. The first steps of this plan went as expected. I arrived around 9 pm at SFO, spent 2.5 hours on the BART to get to Acorn&rsquo;s ( The Bay Area&rsquo;s public transit is a joke ), worked from Acorn's Thursday, and sped through the night, down I-5, to Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>Benny Ruskin, a friend from college had just moved out to attend UCLA Law and was gearing up for his first semester&rsquo;s finals. He&rsquo;d told me he&rsquo;d be studying months before so I knew what to expect. The first night I was there though we went out to The Groundlings, a local breeding ground for SNL talent. Sketch comedy done to the highest level, Benny, his girlfriend Melinda, and I had full belly laughs on very empty bellies. The pizza we&rsquo;d ordered had shown up 1:15 hours late, 15 minutes after we had left, so we were left with a granola bar and plantain chips we purchased from the corner store for dinner. The best two sketches were a gay cruise ship choreographer trying to teach his staff how to perform Frozen and a young girl who was disappointed with the nice presents she had received for Christmas, because MONEY was all she wanted, just like Cardi B had told her. Between sets, the three of us were scheming, planning, dreaming, fantasizing about what we were going to eat afterward. We decided on The Apple Pan, the &ldquo;Best Burger Joint in LA&rdquo;. A shack from the 1940s with a large U-shaped counter with seating for 26. We devoured the burgers too fast for our taste buds to pick up any flavor, but Oh My the banana cream pie!!! Heavenly. I have been dreaming about it nightly since. Dense whipped cream, a thick layer of banana creme, three inches of sliced bananas at their perfect ripeness, and a chewy crust below. I was doubting the order at first, but it may have been the best dessert I&rsquo;ve ever had. The banana flavor was strong but not too sweet. It meant I could down a whole slice and it almost felt healthy.</p>

    <p>Our tour guide, Randi, was pointing at an acre-sized parking lot that was painted light blue and sunken a few feet down. &ldquo;They shot the parting of the Red Sea here for the movie 10 Commandments here. How do you think they did it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They filmed it in reverse!&rdquo; A blond woman in the back piped up.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Exactly. They had barriers, which they pulled back to let the water rush in, and then they played it in reverse.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I was on the Paramount Studios tour, the oldest production house in LA, and movie magic was everywhere. On a property a few city blocks square, movies such as Rear Window, Airplane!, Forrest Gump, and many more were written, cast, shot, edited, and produced. Everywhere you looked had been used for a shot at one time or another. There was a back alley where many of the getaway scenes for NCIS were filmed. The writer's building doubled as an embassy for Mission Impossible. The entrance of the Paramount movie theatre was once transformed into a swanky hotel lobby. It was amazing looking at this banal scenery and seeing how by adding a couple of details and shooting from a specific angle it believably showed up on the big screen as something else.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hitchcock was one of the big-time directors we had here at Paramount, but he was chronically going over budget and breaking rules so they moved his office there, right next to the executive offices. It did not work, he put a bookcase up against the windows so nobody could see in. One time he wanted four-story buildings inside studio 16, which would have meant building a taller building. The request was declined, so in the middle of the night he locked the doors and dug down 15 feet to get the desired angle for the shot.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are now passing the Foley Department. They are responsible for creating the sounds you hear during movies. Coconut shells for horse hooves, snapping celery for breaking bones, lasering grapes for dying aliens.&rdquo; WHATTTT lasering grapes for aliens?! Such a cool department. Those folks must always walk with perked ears, on the lookout for a more believable replica sound.</p>

    <p>The final stop on the tour was the set of Grace and Frankie. I watched an episode of the show later that day and it was unbelievable how they make it feel like a luxurious beach house. The set doesn&rsquo;t even have running water! They use a hose to pump water to the sink and have a bucket underneath to catch the runoff. Forget about the second floor, it doesn't exist. It is a stairway to nowhere. The ceiling isn't real, it flaps up to allow for more lighting during daylight scenes and flaps down when the ceiling would be in the shot. It gave me a new appreciation for actors. The setting was so fake, it seemed impossible to have real emotion. Yet somehow they had to show feelings while ignoring the fans on the far side of the plywood walls trying to simulate a sea breeze.</p>

    <p>The Los Angeles Acropolis, built high up in the hills from where you can see both the Pacific ocean and the Angeles mountains. The Getty Center, a modern take on a retirement home for art. After all, museums do rather little to support current artists, they are better described as Art Hall of Fames. These Hall of Famers were from Paul Getty&rsquo;s personal collection. The inspiration for the movie All the Money in the World, his money had purchased the land, commissioned Richard Meier as architect, and endowed the museum with $1.2 billion. Having now grown to $6.2 billion the Getty is the best-endowed museum in the world. The result is a world-class museum that is free to the public.</p>

    <p>From the parking lot, you are taken by tram up through the manicured gardens to the public square. Vast and tiled with travertine, it was apparent immediately that the place was playing against classical architecture. The building was not symmetrical, there were columns that were square instead of round, the fountains had interesting looking rocks in the place of statues. I immediately walked up the front steps and hopped on an architecture tour that was just starting. &ldquo;The buildings were built atop two ridgelines that meet at a 22.5-degree angle and everything on the campus is aligned with one ridgeline or the other.&rdquo; &ldquo;The travertine stones were mined at Bagni di Tivoli in Italy and there are 27 especially beautiful stones which have been hidden away as treats for the especially adventurous.&rdquo; &ldquo;Richard Meier always makes white buildings, but the wealthy neighbors of Bel-Air and Brentwood made him tone it down to this cream color.&rdquo; &ldquo;The curves of the building on the right side are meant to mimic the ocean waves which are visible off in the distance on the right.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the stones are 30x30 inches or some common fraction like 15x15, or 7.5x7.5&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Tour over I walked through the welcoming rotunda and out into the central courtyard. It was rather odd looking, the buildings around had all these funky shapes. There was no clear entrance or place to start. It was like a true American public square where all the buildings were built during different eras and to different tastes and thus you are left with a hodgepodge of matter that doesn't look all that good together. Except here all the buildings were built with those 30x30 travertine tiles which gave the space its continuity. It meant the space felt textured like there were tons of areas to explore, rather than a haphazard collection of misfits. Upon further exploration, this turned out to be true. There were small fountains hidden behind buildings, a cacti garden with a view of LA in the back, and sightlines that went through all the buildings across campus along the old mountain ridgelines. Once inside one of the four main buildings, order was restored. Sculptures and other physical arts were on the first floor, paintings on the second. And the buildings housed art in chronological order, starting with Medieval Art and finishing with 20th-century photography. I didn&rsquo;t have all that much time to explore the exhibits, but the ones I saw, impressionism and 20th-century photography, were excellent. I had mostly come for the architecture and because Isabel, a museum lover, had said it was her favorite museum in the world.</p>

    <p>My criteria for good architecture is &lsquo;does it improve on nature?&rsquo;. Would I rather see this or the land in its natural form? Most things don&rsquo;t make the cut. Many old neighborhoods do; I would much prefer walking around Back Bay in Boston that the marshy bog it replaced. I am not sure the Getty as a whole makes the cut. It is interesting, but is it better than the last untouched ridgeline in the LA hills? It feels like a concept car, designed to provoke thought, but not necessarily attractive or useful yet. There were moments of brilliance though. The framed shots around the campus complement nature beautifully. Meier accomplished these by making cutouts in the travertine to reveal a particularly beautiful scene behind. In his most extreme example, he built an unnecessary square addition to the top edge of a building so that the view of the sky through it would be framed. It was a novel idea to me and the frame made whatever was inside better looking. It focused your eye on the specific rather than a whole landscape, which is difficult to take in. Each framed shot of nature was like a little piece of art against which the art inside the buildings should be compared. &ldquo;Does this framed piece of art improve on this framed piece of nature?&rdquo;</p>

    <p> The next day I went on a long walk around some of those famous LA neighborhoods I&rsquo;d only ever heard of, Hollywood, Venice, Santa Monica, Melrose. My conclusion: it is funny to call LA a city. San Francisco is a bit the same way. They are distributed systems. Each neighborhood has its own commercial area, usually a line of shops half a mile long, that is wholly disconnected from any other commercial area. Each neighborhood is a self-contained organism and a form of transportation like a bus, scooter, or most often a car, is needed to get from one fiefdom to another.</p>

    <p>Both cities were a bit difficult to understand, so diffuse in their energy. No beating heart like the old east coast cities. Their energy was like the open circulatory system of arthropods, free to flow this way and that. Easily you could have visited and felt like you hadn&rsquo;t seen THE CITY, you&rsquo;d missed it somehow. In some ways it was nice. It meant the claustrophobia of a place like Times Square was absent. Hollywood in comparison felt quite manageable and tame. One could stop and pause by their favorite star and people had plenty of space to go around on either side of you; the buildings rose maybe 10 stories, the lights neon, but not overwhelming, almost tasteful. They were all wonderful little neighborhoods, each potentially charming, but it felt wrong to call a collection of them a city. They were suburbia at its finest.</p>
