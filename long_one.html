        <h1>The Long One</h1>
        <h3><a name="Chapter1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        <p>
            My reasons for the trip were a bit of a mystery even to myself. For a couple of months I had come up with various reasons to different friends, none of which felt particularly accurate. Part certainly came from being without a bed to call my own, having let my lease go at the end of August. I had the ambition of playing professional golf, if only for a few years, and this fall was to be my time to try and qualify for the tour. After a miserable summer of amateur golf tournaments though, it was utterly and completely clear that I was not ready. Such an attempt costs an entry fee of around $5,000 so nothing to take lightly if you are not feeling confident. Thus I found myself in September no longer living with my best pals from college, without much of an idea for what came next.
        <br><br>
            This was only a fraction of the reason though. A new lease starting in September is not hard to find in the city of Boston, and the ties to a great group of college friends and my girlfriend who also lived in Cambridge were strong incentives to stay. Instead the call to the road came mostly from desire rather than necessity. A New York City kid, schooled and living in Boston, I was decidedly unacquainted with much of the country. From a youth spent playing golf and soccer tournaments I knew the eastern seaboard from Maine to North Carolina, but had only jetted in and out of a scant number of other places around the country. This fed a sense of claustrophobia and restlessness that was certainly part of my reason.
        <br><br>
            Growing up in a family where my father often referenced his great journeys across the country and around the globe, and in a country where individualism and exploration are part of its ethos, such a trip felt like a requirement of a well lived life. Soon to be 25, I saw many a long path before me. Qualifying and playing golf into my year 30s. Starting a company and its many early years of hard toil. A serious relationship and eventually the time requirements of a family. All roads leading away from free time and the long one. Maybe premature but fleeting opportunities on the horizon and the sinking feeling of passing youth were strong factors in deciding to drive across the United States from Massachusetts to California and many places in between.
        <br><br>
            This is not an exhaustive list of my reasons. Many more which I have yet to suss out feel to be lurking in the recesses of my mind. I haven't tried too hard to figure them out though. The important thing was going.
        <br><br>
            And so I found myself sitting in front of my boss, in a newly renovated and still very sparsely decorated office, asking him what he thought about me working remotely. “My sister is in Houston. She is a reporter there. Growing up in New York, I have lived in Boston for six years now, with school and now Redline, and I am growing kind of tired of it.” “Six years, I’ve lived here for 43 years,” Mark interjected. “Hahaha, yeah i don't know, I just want a change out of the northeast...and I was thinking about joining her in Texas. What do you think about me moving to remote work?” This was more than an arms length from the truth, but I did not want to make it too complicated for him. My plan was to depart in early October, with stops in Buffalo, Cedar Rapids Iowa, Rapid City SD, Denver, Jackson Hole WY, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Houston, and New Orleans by Christmas. For the past couple years, rather than giving each other presents my family took a little trip. This year we were spending Christmas in New Orleans, which made it the logical time and place for the trip to end. Once January hit I planned on coming back east for a few weeks to visit the girlfriend and former housemates. Then heading back to Texas, possibly Hoston, for February, March, and April, to prepare for the upcoming golf season. Houston was definitely a stop on the trip and possibly my location in the spring, but I told my boss Houston because I wanted him to say yes, and working remotely from Texas sounded a lot better than working from the road on a 5,000 mile 3 month long road trip. From my perspective remote was remote, and as long as I was completing my work, it did not matter where I was located. I just needed my boss to say yes. I also thought there was little possibility that work would find out about the plan so I wasn't too concerned about telling a white lie.
        <br><br>
            For a pretty low key guy who gives his employees a long leash, Mark took a long while to consider this idea. For a two week period I came into work thinking I’d hear the decision. Mark would walk into my office, me thinking he would say “Owen, do you have a moment?” and sweep his hand in the direction of his office; instead he was there to ask how progress was going on one customer ticket or another. At this point, due to my own initial procrastination in asking and Mark taking longer than expected in answering, it was late August and my lease was up in a week and a half. I needed to know where I stood, so if I did not get approval, I could act quickly to find a lease starting in September.
        <br><br>
            I walked into his office in the late afternoon, after Mark was finished with his multiple morning calls, and after I had time to complete enough work so I could give a positive status update if I was asked. Knocking on the door, “Hey Mark, do you have a moment?” Assent given with a nod of the head. “Have you had a chance to review my request? My lease is coming up and I kinda need to know one way or the other.” “Yes, yes, Houston, that's okay. Performance must stay high. Working remotely there are fewer remedies if performance drops.” “Thank you very much Mark!! I do not see any reason why performance would drop.” The two senior engineers on my team also worked remotely so all questions I had during a day of work had to be asked across the company chat app, Slack, anyway. My excitement made me pop up out of my chair and shake his hand. I was going, going on the long one.

            “Bad, bad, not good.”
            “What?”
            “My suit bag.”
            “You left it?”
            “Bad.” Shaking my head.
            “You left it at my apartment?”
            “Worse.”
            “You left it with the roommates at 91?”
            “Worse.”
            “You left it at J and Travis’s?”
            “Worse.” Bumping my head against the side of the car now.
            “You left it on the street?”
            “Indeed.”
            “NOOOOOOO!”, Isabel let out sympathetically. "That's literally worst case scenario. My house or 91 and I coulda just sent it. What are you gonna    do? The Dakotas and Jackson are gonna be cooold.” Thanks for that Isabel.
        <br><br>
            A sizable pause to let the news sink into both of us.
        <br><br>
            All of my jackets and warm weather tops were MIA. Left on the stoop of a random house on Lee St. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This was the moment   I realized, getting out of my car in Buffalo, New York.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            It had been over a month since I had been granted approval to work remotely, and I had spent my time bumming around Boston. September is a glorious month in the bay state, so I hung around, staying at Isabel’s and on friends' couches. Wonderful weekend activities ensued; a weekend on the cape with my former housemates, a weekend in Newport with Isabel, a wedding in the Berkshires of a family friend. It was a charmed month. Not having a place to stay made departure feel imminent and thus activities and emotions were at heightened levels.
        <br><br>
            It was a month of extra rounds and toasts, toasts to the end of the college lifestyle and the past two year together. Friends from college, we had made the conscious decision that we wanted to live together after graduation. We thought at no other time of life were we going to be able to live with 3 of our best friends. Although we had various ideal paths for ourselves we thought living together would be an experience we would rue missing. And it really was more than we could have hoped for. Trying to explain such friendships always comes up short and sound all too clique, but we really were guys who cared about one another. Thus this month was more than me leaving, with a couple of our other friends had left and one of my housemates Zach was thinking of moving to DC come January, the post grad era was ending, our friendships were likely at their most intense. We did not want it to but life was moving us on.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Finally I had all my stuff packed and on the curb next to my car at 9:15 on Thursday morning. Isabel had taken two days off work, the first to head north early Thursday morning go visit her mother for her 60th birthday, and the second for us to drive out to Buffalo. I planned on staying at the housemates Thursday night and picking Iz up wherever her sister dropped her off Friday morning. Thus my box of snacks, my two bags of clothes, my suit bag, my golf bag, my camping gear, my kettlebell, my toolbox, and an extra pillow were all strewn on the wetness beside Norman. With Norman, a little two door hyundai accent, packing had to be deliberate. Golf bag on the left side, clothes bags on the top of the folded down back row, snacks and camping gear on the flat nearest the trunk door, and finally pillow and kettlebell wedged behind the passenger seat.
        <br><br>
            “Big road trip?”
            “Indeed, I am actually driving cross country to San Francisco.”
            “Oh my. I did that once. Nebraska was sooo goddamn boring. Flat and endless. What route are you taking?”
            “I-90! At least most of the way. Buffalo, Iowa, the Dakotas, Denver, Jackson Hole, San Fran!”
            “A lotta driving. Best of luck. Have fun!”
        <br><br>
            My phone said 9:41, I was quite late for work. I needed all 29 minutes with speeding to make my morning meeting at 10:10. I jumped in the car and sped off, leaving my suit bag right there, on the 3ft tall rock ballast which marked the start of the stairs up to the yellow house, the first one on the right of Lee st.
        <br><br>
            At work I was in serious shit. I’d gotten a bit confused about if Isabel and I were taking Friday off to drive to Buffalo early or if we were leaving after work. She had lived in Buffalo the year before and had been asking me to go for a while. This trip provided the perfect opportunity. Buffalo was on the direct route out, 7 hours west on I-90 from Boston. We’d discussed driving after work on Friday but it meant the weekend activities would be very cramped. On the other hand leaving early friday would require taking a day off, a commodity which Isabel was running low on. Confused about our decision, I did not realize my error until after I had put in my time off request for the following week. I am not proud of it, but I felt weird about asking for another vacation day given how nice they had been in granting me remote work, and so I kept procrastinating. I finally came up with the plan that I would ask for the day off because packing was going very badly. In their minds I was packing up and would be taking the following week off to drive down to Texas, where I would set up shop for the foreseeable future. I would say packing was going so poorly that I thought I’d need to take Friday off in order to finish.
        <br><br>
            But now I was late! It was 9:41 and I needed to ask this morning! I couldn't show up late to our already very leisurely 10:10 meeting and ask for the following day off! I sped. Through Cambridge, onto route 28, and up 1-93 to Woburn. I sprinted up the stairs, put my stuff down, composed myself, and walked into Mark’s office for our morning meeting. The plan was to ask at the end of the meeting when Mark would ask “Anybody have anything else?” With the wording and tone of my request running through my head on repeat, Mark mentioned that he would be out the next day and thus no meeting. I started to think, to conspire. Not proud, not proud, very very guilty. In my dread of asking I kept my mouth shut leaving the insidious plot of just not working on Friday as the plan. Without the morning meeting nobody would check in on me, certainly not on a Friday. None of my work was time critical and I would be able to make it up in the week I had actually taken off.
        <br><br>
            And so I found myself picking up Isabel at 10:30 on a day when I was on the clock. Iz had made such a big deal about how hard it had been for her to take the day off that I had absolutely no courage to tell her about my mischievousness.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            The timing for Iz could not have been worse work wise. Having been put on three upcoming deals, she had worked 12 hours days Monday-Wednesday, only to have to work in the car on the drive out. Huddled over her computer on her vacation day, her focus was so intense that she could not hear the outside world. My questions were not heard much less responded to. After four hours of that, plus not being able to listen to any of my downloaded books because Iz also wanted to listen to them, I was drowsy, testy, and was not having fun. I needed a short snooze and Iz had a call so we switched seats and Iz would talk as she drove.
        <br><br>
            Waking up quite dazed and groggy, I looked down to see the car keys in my lap, my phone saying that 56 minutes had passed, and the car was parked in a service area. Confused, I shuffled out of the car to go to the bathroom and find Iz. Not finding her inside the building or outside on the benches I was befuddled. I went back to the car to get my water bottle to fill up, locked the car with the driver side door button because the key fob seemed to have died, and returned to the building for a second search. I found her near an outlet, hidden by a massage chair, huddled over her computer typing furiously. She had made it 35 minutes before pulling off and getting back online.
        <br><br>
            Still drowsy but exasperated by our slow pace I said I would drive. Getting back in the car I pulled onto the highway and noticed there was definitely something wrong. There was a red light on the dashboard with the letters “tpms”, the clock was blank, the trip odometer had reset to 0, and huh, the interior lights weren’t working either. Thinking back to the service area I wondered if these were related to the car keys not being able to lock or unlock the car remotely. Asking Iz if anything had happened while she was driving, I got no response. Not knowing what was wrong with my car, but knowing something was definitely up, on the opening leg of a 5,000 mile journey, brought my voice up to a volume and tone much too dramatic.
        <br><br>
            Having decided to start dating a year before we were both immensely pleased with how it was going. And I do mean decided. Our fathers being best friends from college, and our families still being close, we had discussions before making the plunge. No getting wet if the relationship didn't have legs. Six months after giving it a shot we had looped the parents in on the situation, much to their audible chagrin. Both fathers were nonplussed, a reaction they have since declared as untrue. Regardless, no damage done. A year in and we were enjoying each other's company immensely. All to say we wanted to have a good weekend. I wasn't sure where life would take me after this road trip, but I did not think a return to Boston was in the cards. Six years living there, long winters, and a world of wonders weighed against it. This might be our last weekend before a long-term long distance relationship.
        <br><br>
            Isabel’s dismissive responses to my continued questions about if something had happened to the car did nothing to dilute my tone or rising worry. Pulling over to the side of I-90 somewhere between Albany and Rochester on a sunny, blustery, fall day, the first car investigation of the trip ensued. The hood was raised, manual brought out, phones sent into action. Much to our novice delight, 10 minutes later we had the working theory that it was a blown fuse, one that controlled the interior lights, clock, odometer, and a couple other things. The details in the manual and our observations matched up. Unable to get the broken fuse out of the power connecter box, an item whose existence we had just learned of, we hopped back in the car and proceeded on our way, our worry eased that anything serious was actually wrong.
        <br><br>
            Not yet well acquainted with the practice of arguing we laughed about how we have gotten a bit taken away.

        <p>
            Darkness descended right around the time when we were arriving at Niagara Falls. Isabel forgot to bring her passport so we were relegated to sticking on the US side. All the pictures which pop into your mind when you think of the falls are from the Canadian side. The US side looks down from the top of the falls, whereas the Canadians have the full expanse of the falls which makes for some great pictures.
        <br><br>
            We found the US side absolutely exhilarating though. Isabel had been to the falls a few times but always from the Canadian side, and found the view down the falls, especially from Luna Island, heart pounding. The water cresting over the edge and dashing down 150 feet onto massive boulders which had broken off the falls years before. Across the way there were massive lights of rotating colors illuminating the falls for the evening onlookers. The light interacting with the mist, occasionally letting enough rays through to give us a view of the drenched boulders below, was mesmerizing. Iz and I went back and forth trying to explain the scene. “It's apocalyptic!” “Looks like the coastline of Maine when a big storm is bearing down.” “These rocks are what specs of dirt would be in a human shower.” From stop to stop within Niagara State Park we would run, just too excited to be there and pumped up from the other wordly scene below.

            The consensus best buffalo wings in Buffalo and a quick tour around Isabel’s old neighborhood, stately 1800’s mansions leftover from the golden age of the Erie Canal interspersed among urban blight and spots of gentrification, before we headed to the airbnb and the discovery of the missing suit bag.
        <br><br>
            Friends from Isabel’s old job joined by significant others and siblings had all rented a house in Ellicottville, a little ways out of Buffalo, as our home base for Fall Fest, the biggest harvest festival in Western New York, and invited us to join for the weekend. The result was 16 people in an AirBnb with beds for 9, plus two couches. Isabel and I were assigned to the top bunk of a twin bed bunk bed. We would be getting very cozy for our final weekend together.
        <br><br>
            Fall fest turned out to consist of a few stages for live music, 100 or so street fair vendors, an assortment of fried foods, and tons of people, all situated in this very picturesque town a bit outside of Buffalo. Two story brick buildings with cute shops, the classic white steeple church, and beautiful fall foliage. Isabel’s friends were super nice, we spent our days drinking and eating our way through fall fest, and our nights fooling around trying not to wake our fellow bunk mates.

        <p>
            Roads were the lifeblood of my trip. I was on an interstate or U.S. highway almost entirely when I was getting from place to place. Most of that time consisted of setting cruise control to 80mph and doing my best to not fall asleep as I sped across some supersized state. This was expected when I departed Boston. Distances would be jammed into tight time frames, so lollygagging on backroads at night trying to discover new things was out of the question. What I did not expect was how much the history of our highways fascinated me, or how well their story explained the reasons for much of what I was seeing around me. So much so that when I felt the desire to put my trip on paper, which would undoubtedly peak after completely failing at a happy hour to explain my favorite part of the trip, I also felt like the story could not properly be told without also talking about the things floating around my head while on the road. Thus, scattered amongst the narrative of my trip, I will be splicing in topics that I found particularly relevant to my travels. Sometimes I searched out the topic, like when I downloaded a book about the National Parks before I left Boston, others presented themselves, like when I didn’t understand why I saw tons of wind turbines in Iowa, but few in neighboring ND, SD, and NB, even though those states sat on the best wind producing land in the country, so I downloaded a book on wind energy. I hope by talking about them you gain the context for why I was so excited to visit Yellowstone or see the oil rigs of West Texas and thus you enjoy the book more. Either way these are not my original thoughts, more excerpts of books I listened to while on the road combined with subsequent research and personal experiences. For this section most of my information comes from Big Roads by Earl Swift, a remarkably engaging book given the topic.

            In 1892 horses in New York City produced 6,000 gallons of urine and 2.5 million pounds of manure per day. With a horse for every six of the city’s residents, the city was drowning in an equine stench. Combined with the cost of feeding and keeping the horses in good health, equal to the cost of maintaining the nation’s rail system, horses were begging to be replaced. Today, I was cruising along at 80mph on an interstate highway headed west; smooth, well-paved, at least two lanes in each direction, 15ft median, banked curves, and no more than 3% curves, these roads give the driver freedom, speed, and comfort unimaginable 120 years ago. They are also the product of the largest public works project in history and the culmination of a saga that explains how and why much of the United States looks the way it does today.
        <br><br>
            Carl Fischer, born 1874, a sixth-grade dropout, prankster, and salesman, was transformed by his visit, with friend and future racing legend Barney Oldfield, to America’s first auto show at Madison Square Garden. He returned to Indianapolis transfixed by these new mechanical buggies, sold his bicycle shop, and opened the Fisher Automobile company, the first auto dealership in the United States. In order to drum up sales he performed outlandish stunts: he dropped a Stoddard Dayton car from a sixth-floor downtown window to show how sturdy they were and then had it driven from the scene; another time he attached a balloon to a Stoddard Dayton and flew out of town, promising to drive back from wherever he landed. Indianapolis loved it and Fisher became a local celebrity. The issue was that, no matter what he did on the sales front, American vehicles and the roads available to drive them on were woefully inferior to their European counterparts.
        <br><br>
            At the turn of the 20th century, the most common road improvement was to grade a dirt path in an attempt to smooth out its humps and bumps. A step up was a sand and clay mixture spread over an earthen bed which drained well and packed down hard with use. Above that was a gravel road that needed constant redressing due to constantly scattering pebbles. At the top of the pecking order was Macadam: a layer cake construction of crushed rock. Macadam consisted of a bottom level of large broken stones that were passed over with a heavy roller. Smaller broken stones were spread atop and pressed again by a heavy roller. Rock dust was then sprinkled on top of all that, watered down, and rolled a third time. Under the weight of the rollers, the rocks would stitch together forming a relatively smooth and stable surface. Yet in 1909, of the countries 2.2 million miles of roads, only 8% had been improved in any way. During the rainy season, these unimproved dirt paths would become impassable and maroon farmers away from market for weeks at a time. Cars were not much better, with hand-cranked starters, no tops, constant flat tires, and liable to loud backfires.
        <br><br>
            Fisher’s solution was to build an auto racing track where the best cars and road materials of the day could be tested and improved. With his hometown of Indianapolis vying with Detroit as the auto capital of the nation, he figured it would be as good a place as any to build his track. Using the finest technique of the day, bituminous macadam, Fisher constructed a 2.6-mile track with perfectly banked corners. Driving legend and friend Barny Olefield remarked, “two miles per minute can be made with no greater danger [on the curve] than on the flat.” Unfortunately, the macadam construction, though sturdy at slow speeds, was not capable of remaining stitched together under the strain of solid rubber tires spinning at high speeds. On the first day of racing, just halfway through a 250-mile race Louis Chevrolet caught a rock through his goggles and had to be walked to the hospital. Then during the last race on the final day of the opening weekend, the front tire of the car driven by local boy Charles Merse exploded and his car went careening into the crowd, killing many. AAA threatened to boycott any future races if the track was not completely overhauled and the local coroner blamed the deaths on the inadequate track conditions. Fisher vowed for a complete overhaul, and with the help of friend Arthur C. Newby repaved the entire track with 3.2 million 10 lb bricks. Thus the brickyard was formed and two years later at the first Indy 500, 80,000 spectators were in attendance.
        <br><br>
            Fischer, as well known and connected as anyone in the auto business at this point, next turned his attention to a transcontinental road. Cars were flying off lots as quickly as they could be produced. Vehicle registrations were on the brink of topping 1 million in 1912, having quadrupled in four years. People loved the sense of freedom the car offered and found them far more sanitary than their equine counterparts. Much cheaper too, after factoring in the cost of maintaining the buggies drive train. What was lacking were good roads to drive them on. Any ride into the country was an adventure requiring a four-foot plank, multiple spare tires, mechanical knowhow, and sometimes a tent if things went south. And that was when conditions were good. In the rainy season, dirt roads turned into mud and transportation was put on hold. Fisher had little faith that government was up to the task. “The highways of America are built chiefly of politics, whereas the proper material is crushed rock or concrete.” He thought it was up to industry to lead the way and show what was possible. He envisioned a transcontinental highway spanning a dozen states from New York to California. Dry, smooth, safe and not just passable, but comfortable in the rainy seasons. At a dinner in Indianapolis of 50 or so industry leaders, Fisher unveiled his plan. The highway would follow existing roads for much of its length, new construction connecting just those pieces which failed to connect, and then over time upgrading the entire highway to a uniform standard. Industry would provide the materials for the job, costing about $5000 per mile, and the public the muscle, with volunteers and local governments actually doing the labor. “Let’s build it before we are too old to enjoy it!” he implored his audience.
        <br><br>
            After lavish scouting trips, with western governors promising the moon and more to the passing highwaymen, the newly named Lincoln Highway’s routing was decided based on which was the shortest path. Leaving New York it would follow a well-established route down to Philadelphia and across the midsections of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, to the outskirts of Chicago, before charting a new path through Cedar Rapids Iowa, Omaha Nebraska, and Cheyenne Wyoming, onto the old pony express trail through Salt Lake City all the way to San Francisco. On Halloween day 1913 the Lincoln was dedicated with fireworks, dances, and speeches in all the towns along the route. Over the next couple of years, these towns took pride in improving their sections of the highways. New Jersey remade its section in brick and concrete. In Illinois, thousands of adults and children voluntarily wielded picks and shovels trying to make their section the finest along the entire route. The improvements made a difference. Double the traffic passed through Ely Nevada in 1915 than the year earlier. Fish Springs Utah saw an uptick to 225 cars from 52 two years before. One driver even traveled the entire length in 6 days, 10 hours, and 59 minutes.

            Soon imitators were everywhere. The Jefferson Davis Highway from DC to SF by way of New Orleans; The Lakes to Gulf Highway from Duluth Minnesota to Galveston Texas; Ficher’s new project, the Dixie Highway from Chicago through Indy and Nashville, to his new development on a sandbar in Florida; and 250+ other named trails. More than 40 crossed Indiana and 64 were registered in Iowa alone. With each trail came a unique blaze design, tacked to trees, fences, and telephone poles, along its route. The Lincoln’s for example, was red, white, and blue, with a black capital L on the white stripe. The trouble was that the trails overlapped, a single stretch of road could be co-opted by a half-dozen trails, and the telephone poles could end up looking like a bunch of help wanted posters. Thus deciphering where one blaze ended and the next began, and which blaze you were supposed to follow, was a dangerous proposition, especially when many of the trails were more branding than improved road. They were a patchwork and inconsistent, but in total, they created our nation’s first interstate highway system. Further progress would have to wait until after The Great War.

            Part two of our highway story begins as Americans returned from the Great War victorious, and took to the streets like never before. 1,396,892 cars were produced in 1919, the first year after the war; 1,731,435 cars two years after that. The cobweb of trail associations with their semi-improved roads wasn’t cutting it. The call for a national grid of federal highways became deafening. With the speedy passage of the AASHO (The American Association of State Highway Officials) bill on Nov 9, 1921, they had their answer. States would remain the source of highways plans and the federal government the enforcer of design, construction, and maintenance standards. Each state was to designate a system of roads on which all federal aid was to be spent and which did not exceed 7% of the state’s total mileage. Additionally, each road within the system was to be labeled as either a primary or secondary road. The former being of an interstate nature, the latter connecting farms to market, small towns to one another, and other strictly local destinations. With its passage, the single most important ingredient of our modern road system came into being.
        <br><br>
            At the head of its implementation stood Thomas Macdonald, an Iowan curmudgeon, who as a kid required his younger sibling to call him sir, and would go on to serve as highway chief for six consecutive presidents. Called chief by everyone, including his wife, he was a meticulous engineer who had the respect and trust of everyone in Washington. Facts, figures, and research were the backbone of the department’s decisions under his leadership. Thus after the department sent maps to the 48 states asking for their primary and secondary road candidates, he asked a trusted young engineer Edwin W. James to lead a committee to come up with an internal model of where they thought roads should go, so the department could better judge the quality of the state’s choices. For this task James collected the population totals for each county from the previous census, plus four economic indicators: agricultural production, manufacturing output, mineral yield, and income from forest products. Then he assigned a number of 100 to a state’s total population and a number to each county based on its percentage contribution. He repeated the exercise for the four economic indicators. Averaging the numbers gave a quick and dirty gauge for a county’s relative importance. James then shaded in each county, darker for increased importance within the state. Once finished the committee had a map with best to worst routing possibilities staring them in the face. Good routes would be darkly shaded and go through the more important or economically rich counties. It would also be easy to see that a state's choice was clearly erroneous, if it went through lightly shaded counties. The state’s nominations started rolling in and for the most part adhered to the federal model. In total the proposed roads would stretch 168,881 miles and reach 90% of the nation’s population, with not one or two transcontinental routes but dozens.
        <br><br>
            Next up was the naming of the new roads. At a joint meeting of state and local highwaymen led by Macdonald, four pillars of road design were hammered out. First, it was quickly agreed to number the nation's roads rather than naming them and to choose the routes to be included before applying the numbering. Second, Frank Rodgers of Michigan doodled a shield like that which adorns the $1 bill and passed it to Edwin W. James who added a small US over a large route number and the name of the state above the shield’s crown. The design was approved on the spot as the market which would identify all the routes included on the numbered system. Third, the men formally adopted the red, yellow, green, stop light sequence. And finally, they approved many road sign designs, one of which was the octagonal stop sign, painted black on yellow at the time because a durable red paint would not be available until the mid 50s. The actual numbering of the system was delegated to a committee chaired by James to decide. AB Fletcher, a former California highway chief, came to James proposing the grandest highway of them all, stretching from the top of Maine down to the southern tip of Florida in Key West, with the fitting name of highway 1. Thinking about it James wondered where 2, 5, 10 and 50 would be laid. A pattern suggested itself. “It stares one in the face, it is so simple and adjustable.” He would assign even numbers to all the east west highways and odd numbers to all those running north south. The numbering would be lowest in both directions in the northeast corner of the country at Maine’s border with Canada and would climb as one moved south and west. One or two digit numbers would denote principal highways, with three digit numbers signaling a spur or variant of a main route. To bring more order the major transcontinental routes going east west would have numbers ending in 0 and the most important north south highways would have numbers ending in 1. Thus with route 2 running east west in the northernmost climbs and route 98 running deep in the south, route 50 was almost guaranteed to run like a belt across the country’s middle. Likewise the intersection of routes 21 and 60 would indicate you were towards the east and just a little south of center. Unfortunately, when the agriculture secretary signed off on the plan, there were scores of complaints from trail associations about their assigned numbering or lack of inclusion and from states about their lack of major routes. The most serious complaint came from Kentucky Governor William J. Fields, who pointed out route 60 did not run from the east coast to the west as one might predict, but from Chicago on a long arching route through St. Louis, Tulsa, and Albuquerque to Los Angeles. US 50 missed Kentucky to the north and US 70 missed it to the south, so US 60 in theory should go through the very important state of Kentucky. With a contingent of his state’s congressmen, Fields took his case to the chief. Macdonald was won over by Fields’ use of logic to point out the flaws in the map. The route from Newport News VA to Springfield MO, running through Kentucky would now be named US 60 and the Chicago to LA route renamed route 66. And thus the historic route 66 was born! That was not the only anomaly in the numbering though. Highways braided, sometimes in their proper sequence, but other times not at all. US 11 for instance curved so much at its southern end that it ended west of route 49. The Lincoln, the nation’s first mother road, became route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming, before turning into a half dozen other numbers towards its end. The last contribution to highway history the Lincoln would make was in Woodbridge NJ where it was upgraded with a novel grade separation allowing the motorist to turn right or left onto the other road without having to stop. Named for its appearance from above, we know it today as a cloverleaf and it was the first of its kind in the states.
        <br><br>
            The very next year after the AASHO bill’s passage, 10,000+ miles of federal aid highways were built, with Motor Life Magazine saying of Macdonald, “At his nod millions move from the US Treasury. Neither Morgan, nor Rockefeller, nor Carneigie, ever had the spending of so much money in so short a period of time.” Meanwhile the automobile industry continued to boom. In 1922 Essex developed the first enclosed car, sealed off from the elements, making motoring a year round endeavor. In 1923 american factories produced 3.9 million cars and trucks with registrations topping 15 million. With all these new highways and new drivers, businesses started appearing on the roadside catering to the motorist. Lodging began simply with towns offering public campgrounds equipped with a tent site, fire ring, trash can, and parking spot. For profit campgrounds then sprang up boosting offerings such as little cabins for those not inclined to tents. The idea took hold and roadside cabin camps were available coast to coast. Some went as far as offering Simmens or BeautyRest beds, and dropping cabin from their name in favor of motor court or motel.
        <br><br>
            These new roads were not just a new toy for the weekend joy ride though, they were fundamentally changing the appearance of their surroundings. When personal speed had topped out at a horse's trot cities tended to be compact and mostly circular in shape. The invention of commuter rail allowed workers to live along the rail lines; resulting in development like the spokes of a wheel as the train lines radiated out from the city center. The advent of the car filled in the in between places and then began to grow outwards.
        <br><br>
            It did not take long for the new US highways, built right through the center of towns, to start clogging up with the incredible influx of new vehicles. As they did the bypass movement began. The theory went that by building a route around the city much of the traffic would be diverted around the clogged center heart. Unfortunately, it would be discovered that most of traffic was intra-city with a very small contribution being made by through travelers. Journeys of less than 30 miles accounted for 88% of all trips, and those of greater than 500 miles accounted for less than .1%. The bypass failed in another way as well. With cities growing like a stain outward a new bypass would in 5 years be gobbled up by the city. Businesses would sprout up on its edges and a new bypass would need to be built even farther out.
        <br><br>
            By the 1940s people came to see that the US highway system, and subsequent bypasses, were not the solution to all their congestion troubles. As Benton Mackay, the father of the Appalachian Trail, said of the US highways, “the flanks are crowded with food stands, souvenir shops, and billboards, each an eyesore, and parking lots and driveways a potential hazard….A break from America’s equine past required a highway completely free from horses, carriages, pedestrians, towns, and grade crossings. A highway built for the motorist and kept free from encroachment except for the filling stations and restaurants needed for his convenience.” He was asking for a grade separated, limited access highway with all the fluff removed from its sides.

        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Little did Mackey know but a plan for such a system was already underway. In 1938 Macdonald got called to a meeting with FDR in the White House where the president drew six blue lines, three vertically from north to south, and three horizontally from coast to coast. He was intrigued with the idea of building such roads and asked the chief to look into the matter and report back.
        <br><br>
            A few weeks later Macdonald received a similar request from Congress to report on the feasibility of such transcontinental routes. Titled, Toll Roads and Free Roads, the report was split into two parts, on the feasibility of transcontinental toll roads, and an alternative conceived of by the bureau. In summary it said that the six transcontinental routes were buildable sure enough, but that they would not address the country's true highway needs, nor recover their costs in tolls. The cost of such a system would be 184 million per year through 1960, but by the most optimistic estimate they would recover only 72.4 million in tolls each year. Even the NJ to CT section, the busiest in the system, would fail to break even. Plus coast to coast traffic amounted to only 300 cars per day. Only 800 cars travelled to the west coast from any location east of the Mississippi. Such demand did not justify a huge public outlay. Macdonald thought that an overbuilt road was every bit as shameful as a deficient one. Unless it was justified economically, it failed, regardless of its engineering.
        <br><br>
            Part two of the report, the alternative, suggested a 26,700 mile system of free highways which was the first blueprint for the modern interstate highway system. It’s millage would be twice that of FDR’s six transcontinental routes with most of its legs not superhighways but two laners, no more and no less than their usage demanded. The second part of the report also went out of its way to emphasize the need for urban highways. Congestion wasn’t caused by thru traffic mixing with local. It was caused by a multitude of small movements by locals. For example, of the 20,500 vehicles entering DC each day, only 2,269 or 11% were by-passable. The answer wasn’t to bend a highway around a city, but to drill it right through its middle. As for tolls, they had no place on these or any road. Roads were a birthright akin to public schooling. Plus tolls saddled engineers with a no win situation; to attract users the toll road had to offer a better product than parallel free roads, which limited the possible improvements to those free roads no matter how badly needed they were. Alternatively, improve the free roads too much and your toll road would lose too many customers and require state subsidy.
        <br><br>
            Looking past the war, FDR saw the need for re-incorporating millions of fighting men back into the economy and retooling the country’s high revving war industries once the fighting stopped. Thus in 1943 he sent an updated draft of the report to congress, urging prompt action to facilitate the acquisition of land, the drawing of plans, and the preliminary work which must precede actual construction. It received a warm reception on the hill and in 1944 congress incorporated the proposal into the annual highway bill with little fanfare. It went “There shall be designed within the continental United States a national system of interstate highways, and which specified such a system should not top 40,000 miles in length and should be so located to connect by routes direct as practicable the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers to serve the national defense and to connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the Republic of Mexico.” The bill also specified a quarter of each year’s appropriation could go towards building urban highways. Unfortunately, the bill provided no special financing for the system or a timeline of when construction would begin. Yet it was still a major step. It committed the interstates to paper, now all that was needed was to find the money to build them.
        <br><br>
            Years passed and the need for the new Interstates only grew. Population numbers exploded. New Orleans doubled in size in the 40’s. SF multiplied 2.5 times its pre-war size. And more cars than ever were getting pumped onto the nation’s roads. In 1949 three fourths of all the cars on the planet were located in the US. New York alone thought it would cost $1 billion to restore its roads to the efficiency they enjoyed in 1930.
        <br><br>
            In steps Eisenhower, commander of allied forces during World War II, and newly minted President of the United States. To my uneducated mind he was the father of the interstate, because well, his name was on the little blue signs on the side of the road, Eisenhower Interstate System above a ring of five white stars. Such a theory sounded nice when combined with two trips Ike took earlier in his career which showed him the necessity of good roads. The first was in 1919 when as a young officer he took part in a military caravan to the west coast along the Lincoln Highway that was felled by every type of misfortune a road trip back then was liable to. The second was advancing across the impeccably built German autobahns on the Allies march to Berlin. Wrong. The interstates were a done deal in every major aspect except for financing by the time he entered politics. On the day when FDR called the chief to his office and drew those six blue lines Eisenhower was serving in the Philippines as chief of staff to Douglas Macarthur. When FDR submitted the highway report to congress Ike was just taking command of allied forces in Europe. When the system received its first paltry $25 million allocation Ike was the head of the West’s cold war alliance. In fact by the time Ike took office in 1953 the system had been in existence for 8 years. Nevertheless as I drove on I-90 west out of Buffalo with the sparkling water of the Erie on my right, it was Eisenhower’s name on the little blue sign which adorned the shoulder of the road. That is because with some encouragement from Ike, congress passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 funding the system Macdonald and Fairbank had put on paper 18 years earlier. The bill stipulated 90% federal financing of a 40,000 mile interstate system to be built over the next 13 years. The money would come from new taxes on tires and gasoline which would be put into a new Highway Trust Fund to be used only for highways.
        <br><br>
            The bureau, with a new head engineer Frank Turner, a soft spoken bus-riding Macdonald protege who had proven himself on the Alaska Highway and by helping rebuild the Philippines after the war, had been busy in the intervening years testing the best materials and designs for the new system. For signage they hired a corps of engineers to drive around a parking lot at night perring at signs containing six words, balk, farm, navy , stop, zone, and duck, in different combinations of typeface and spacing. Green, blue, and black signs were also tried. Nearly 6 in 10 favored a green background, up and down lettering was prefered to all caps, and as spacing between letters increased so did the distance at which people could read them. To determine the proper road material, six test loops were built of varying paving material and thickness, 836 sections in all, on which army transport soldiers would drive 126 trucks around in circles for 19 hours per day for 2 years. By the end the soldiers had racked up 17 million miles. The conclusion, the thicker the pavement and subgrade, the better. Since the numbering system of the US Highways had worked so well it was recycled with a few minor alterations. To avoid confusion of overlapping numbers between the two systems it was proposed that no state have an interstate and US highway with the same number within its borders. To accomodate this the interstates would be lowest in the south and west and highest at Maine’s border with Canada. Plus, they would ditch I-50 and I-60 to avoid overlapping across the county’s middle. Additionally, the major north south routes would now end in 5 instead of 1. So if you were at the intersection of I-10 and I-5, it meant you were in the south western most part of the states. It also meant that for a road like I-90, which most Bostonians think starts at their city’s airport, actually starts all the way west in Seattle, and terminates at Logan.

            Designed, tested, and now finally financed, the largest public works project in history was underway. Billions started to flow from the governments purse strings, each one creating 48,000 full time jobs for a year, and consuming  16 barrels of cement, 1 billion pounds of steel, 18 million pounds of explosives, 123 million gallons of petroleum products, 152 billion pounds of aggregate, and enough earth to bury NJ knee deep.
        <br><br>
            By 1962 about 12,500 of 30% of the system was open to traffic and another 34 miles were opening every week. They were fast, safe, and Americans absolutely loved them. They loved that they could follow an impulse wherever they chose without surrendering space to a four smelling stranger. They loved the act itself, the feel of the engine under their control. In ____ they topped the projections of miles driven for 1970. Americans did not have an automotive life foisted upon them. They did not buy homes far from work or forsake mass transit or pave over their cities because they were manipulated into doing so. They wanted roads, they wanted the interstates, and they wanted them pronto.
        <br><br>
            Just as with the US Highways, the changes brought by the new roads affected life far off from its paved borders. Small towns bypassed by the interstates found their livelihoods vanish. A gas station on US 80 lost 80% of its customers when I-20 was built. A motel on historic Route 66 in Qualpo Oklahoma bought a few years before for $28,000 was now on the market for $5,000 and finding no takers. Manufacturing left cities for cheap, abundant land near the interstates, which provided them with a ready distribution network. Chrysler cited the proximity of I-90 for building a $850 billion factory in tiny Belvadere Illinois, and I-44 for its construction of an assembly plant in the Ozarks of Missouri. Led by jobs and the desire for a house and a yard, the suburbs boomed. No longer able to locate themselves on the road’s shoulder, housing and shopping developments migrated to exits and radiated out from there; nucleated development it would come to be called. With people and manufacturing jobs leaving, cities’ central business districts began to fall apart. Mass transit withered in the new environment, with low density developments out in the suburbs and jobs spread out all over the place, there were not enough common destinations to make fixed rail lines viable. The only form of transportation suited to this new urban sprawl was the very agent of its change, the car. Thus, in a sick twist of logic, highway men believed that only more and bigger highways could entice suburbanites to make the trek back into the city center and thus avoid a complete abandonment of downtown.
        <br><br>
            The experience of driving changed as well. Everything was sped up. Restaurants began popping up at exits catering to the road warrior in a hurry. They used shorthands, a logo, a color, or a certain shape of the roof to notify the driver of their presence. Their aim was to provide the driver with a predictable experience, such that a traveler might ask themselves, “should I search out a hit or miss local spot that could cost me an hour or should I grab a decent Mcdonalds burger at a great price and be back on my way in 10 minutes flat?” The latter option often won out, which is why today the look and feel of interstate exits with their identical chain restaurants have more in common with one another than they do with the state or locale they are in.
        <br><br>
            Not everybody was overjoyed with these changes. SF had a vision of connecting the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge with a looping freeway along the peninsula's watery edge. What they got was a 57ft tall double decker expressway passing right in front of the Ferry Building and blocking the city’s residents from their historic waterway. The uproar of displeasure was so intense that on Jan 27, 1959 the board of supervisors approved a resolution opposing 7 of the 10 freeways planned for the city. Louis Mumford, the visionary social critique, found his way into the hearts of urban planners everywhere with his scathing critiques of the interstates. “The experts have innocent notions that the problem can be solved by increasing the capacity of the existing traffic routes, or multiplying the number of ways getting in and out of town, or providing more parking spaces for cars. Roads in NYC were designed for a city of four story buildings. Now in effect we have piled three NYC’s on top of one another. The roadway and sidewalks flanking them should, if they are kept at the original ration, be 200 ft wide, the current width of a NYC block.” He went on, “Want to save the cities? Forget about the motor car, the solution laid in restoring a human scale to urban life, in making it possible for the pedestrian to exist. A choice was looming, for either the motor car will drive us all out of the cities, or the cities will have to drive out the motor car.” The most surprising critic of the new urban highways though was the man who spurred their financing. In 1959, on a drive outside Washington to Camp David, Ike’s limo bogged down in traffic due to construction of a new interstate. Riled, Ike demanded an explanation for this was far too close to Washington to comply with Eisenhower’s notion of a largely rural intercity system. An examination of congressional intent insued, but it concluded that every study on which the program had been based was explicit, the country’s highway needs were sharpest in the cities; congress had read those studies, congress had seen the proposed routes drawn out on a map, congress had wanted urban routes. Eisenhower's displeasure with his own system would have to remain just that.
        <br><br>
            The collective acrimony over the damage urban interstates pushed congress in 1968 to require two hearings on federal-aid highways. The first, a corridor hearing, at which taxpayers could speak their minds on a highway’s location. The second, a design hearing, at which they would have the opportunity to affect the projects size and style. In addition, from then on, anyone unhappy with a state highway commission’s decision could appeal the matter directly to the feds on any one of 21 grounds: these included, the state had failed to weigh neighborhood character, property values, natural or historic landmarks, conservation, or the displacement of households or businesses. The grounds for appeal were so commonplace that every remaining interstate project was almost sure to be challenged, and left in a perpetual state of appeals.
        <br><br>
            This marked the beginning of the end for highway building in America. Some of the more difficult portions of the interstate system dragged on for years, but for the most part the roads then are the roads now. The highway program had been bigger than the space program or atomic energy, and had delivered on much of its promise. 70 mph on the flat was attainable year around, and the fatality rate on American roads was just 2.52 per million miles driven, down from 16 in 1929. The cost to uproot and pave over livelihoods became too damn high to build anymore though. As time went by, those cities where the need for highways had been greatest, began calling for public transportation. People saw how the car had gutted many downtowns, leaving them ghostly quiet in the post work darkness. Instead they wanted a return of the tangled, creative, feverish energy only a pedestrian focused metropolis could provide.
        <br><br>
            In 1982 they were successful in splitting the Highway Trust Fund in two with the new part designated for mass transit. Congress also authorized states to scrap existing federal aid highway plans and transfer the money to a mass transit project if they wanted to; thus states would no longer have to turn down federal aid if they did not want to build yet another highway.
        <br><br>
            Highwaymen, for their part, could not understand why they were becoming so maligned. Sure a few urban routes necessitated serious upheaval, but as a whole the interstate system had been built quickly, efficiently, and provided a massive boon to the communities it passed through. Turner viewed highways as windfalls if you counted the amount of time they saved the taxpayer, the lives they spared, and the goods they carried. They were the only government activity which repaid the taxpayer with interest, and they more than compensated for whatever damage they caused.
        <br><br>
            Turner was no foe of mass transit either, in fact, he often spoke keenly of the need for it, of how no one mode of transportation could answer all of a city’s needs. In fact he was downright bullish on the idea, as long as it was provided by the bus, a form of transportation he had commuted on for much of his career. He firmly believed rail base transit would not and could not attract enough riders to justify the fortune it would cost to build, partly because it could not be adapted to changing travel patterns. Cities had changed since the days of the street car, they were now spread too far and wide for fixed rail to take many people from where they were to where they wanted to go. Buses on the other hand made excellent sense. 50 or 60 could move as many people as 3,000 cars, provide almost door to door service, and follow routes that could be adjusted as needed. Plus, they piggy backed on an investment already in place, thus requiring no costly new infrastructure. Like all of his views, his opinion on the bus was supported by research, by statistics. He could cite a 1962 study which found buses and subways moved people for about the same cost, 3.2 cents per person per mile, but that buses were far cheaper to put into service. He acted on his beliefs and in 1969 helped launch an experiment in the DC suburbs, reversible lanes in the median of 1-95 set up for buses alone. When the Washington Post staged a race between a car and bus making the same 11 mile commute, the bus won by 32 minutes. Soon commuters by bus outnumbered their traffic jammed colleagues. Transit officials had to quadruple the bus fleet in order to keep up with demand. In the end the experiment trimmed the highway’s daily load by an estimated 3,140 vehicles per day.
        <br><br>
            “Buses are the answer, the only answer,” Turner said. He could not fathom why environmentalists, the press, and the anti-highway activists didn’t embrace the bus, or why they were so smitten with rail based transit. “The infinite combinations of routings and schedules required by today's urban citizenry dictates that any transportation system must provide flexibility of route, destination and schedule. That’s why fixed route systems, which are basically spoke lines connected to a downtown hub, have such a hard time financing themselves in the fair box. And if they cannot support themselves in the fair box then isn't this a good warning that they may be failing to provide that service which the customer wants?”
        <br><br>
            His favorite whipping boy became the DC metro, a system covering 98 miles at a cost of $3 billion. An amount roughly equal to the capital regions expenditure on roads since the founding of the nation, and about $4,000 for every household. “What a huge capital expenditure to provide for the movement of about 5% of the transportation load within DC’s metropolitan area,” Turner quipped. “Just the annual interest on the debt would buy about 5,000 new buses every New Year’s morning for the whole life of the metro.”
        <br><br>
            I do not have the knowledge or inkling to debate the merits and drawbacks of the urban interstates. Growing up in New York City I saw how valuable the subway and buses were to the millions of people who took them everyday. I either walked or took public transit everyday to school and enjoyed the eclectic creatures I’d see everyday. On the flip side I have also seen how used interstates like the Cross Bronx ( I-95 ), the Deegan ( I-87 ), and the LIE ( I-495 ) are every single day with commuters, delivery trucks, and buses. Without them and the Robert Moses built parkways it would be a nightmare moving across the city at any time of the day. Thus, are they valuable to the city now, yes. Were they worth the destruction of East Tremont and the countless other neighborhoods they drill through, I am not anywhere close to being able to judge. The rural interstates on the other hand have been an unquestionable success. They save lives, time, and open up opportunities for millions of businesses. Maybe Fisher was right about the politics of his time, but in my opinion, the interstates and the US highways are an example of government at its best; building something that everybody wants, but no person, business, or state, has the ability to build themselves.

            That near universal experience of learning a word and then seeing it everywhere, happened to me all the time with the information learned by listening to Big Roads. I now spotted sets of old abandoned cabins by the side of US highways. I saw urban sprawl morph into nucleated development into empty pasture the farther out of town one went. I appreciated the desire for the interstates when strip malls on the shoulders of US highways made the roadway clogged and dangerous. I now understood what direction roads were headed just from parsing the road number and its prefix. My imagination went wild driving across Utah picturing drivers getting bogged down in thigh high dust on this very terrain when on the old Lincoln Highway. Listening to this book was like being given the prism through which America’s physical development makes sense.

        <p>
            11:45 and I awoke from my mid drive stupor. Having pulled over at 8:30 to take a one hour nap, I somehow had slept for three hours and fifteen minutes. Just a bit outside Cleveland, I had 8.5 more hours of driving in the next 13 hours. I was meeting my friend Noah in Cedar Rapids, Iowa at 1pm the next day. Having left Isabel and Buffalo around 4pm, I had cruised through a stunning section of Western New York, leaves of yellow and red dotting the hills far on my left, vineyard after vineyard ticking by on both sides of me, and the sparkling blue of the Erie off in the distance on my right. The fading sun was throwing a golden light over the whole scene making it one of the prettiest sections of the entire trip.
        <br><br>
            After making good time to Cleveland I took a pit stop in Cleveland Heights to take a look at my father's childhood home. He had lived there in his elementary school years and had been nagging me to make the stop. It was a stately brick home on the corner, with a chatty couple sipping wine on the back patio. Other homes in the neighborhood were also very nice, many in the tudor style, with full green lawns and a nicely sized backyard. Yet looking up prices online at dinner the houses in the neighborhood were mostly in the 200-300k range!
        <br><br>
            I got a bit tired an hour later, four hours into the drive and still 3:30 hours from my planned pit stop in South Bend Indiana. That is when I decided to pull over into the service area to take a nap. Flustered by my unplanned hibernation I got out of the car to take a piss, only to slip on some vomit placed directly outside the driver side door. Not great, but at least I was fully recharged. I reevaluated, decided not to pee, and took off down the highway, lots of driving ahead of me.
        <br><br>
            Usually I like driving at night. For one there is much less traffic, but mostly I like that it means I am not wasting a day in the car. On my many trips back and forth from NY and Boston I would usually leave around 9pm, after dinner with the parents or a night hanging with the housemates, and complete the drive in 3:15 hours. It felt like I got two full days on either side of the drive. On the drive to South Bend though, I had the sinking feeling that I was missing out. The whole point of this trip was to see the in-between. To experience all the places that I had never been to before. But under the cover of darkness the landscape's charms were hidden. Every road looks the same at night: the black asphalt or grey cement, the outside white lines, the dashed lane lines, darkness above and on each side. And so Indiana passed by, a mystery to me. I decided in these wee hours to try and favor daytime drives so that I would not miss the in-betweens.
        <br><br>
            A quick 5 hour stopover at a motel 8 and I was back on the road. It was 8:01, I had 4 hours and 58 minutes of driving, and Noah’s plane was landing at 1pm. Looking around, I realized I probably had not missed much in Indiana if it looked at all like Illinois. I-90 cuts through the outskirts of the Chicago sprawl and for a couple hours it was nothing but wide concrete highways, billboards, spaghetti ramps, and the signs of strip malls off to the sides. It was monotonous and depressing driving, such that the corn fields of Iowas were actually a joyous sight.
        <br><br>
            Small farms of corn and soybean, Iowa was exactly as I had imagined. No place on the trip fit with its stereotype quite as well as Iowa. I mean that in a positive way. It looked like the Jeffersonian ideal. The farmhouses and silos were the only interruption to the lines of agriculture flitting by row after row. It was mesmerizing watching out of the corner of your eye each perfectly planted row going tick tick tick. Even the soybeans and grass fields had these perfectly sowed lines. An entire field of grass, looking like absolute chaos from almost every angle would come into perfect organization for a few brief moments.
        <br><br>
            Arriving at the Cedar Rapids Airport was a funny experience being accustomed to the hustle and bustle of LaGuardia or JFK in New York. Not a single car or person was in front of the single terminal airport. The sidewalk in front stretched for 500 ft and not a single soul was present. I leisurely parked right in front and hopped out, not worrying about a screaming traffic cop or honking taxis. Noah walked out a couple of minutes later and we took off, no sign of his fellow passengers or any airport personnel materialized.

        <p>
            We didn't have any definitive plans for the week. We knew we wanted to go to Badlands National Park, Theodore Roosevelt National Park (Noah very much wanted to say he had been to North Dakota), and Mt. Rushmore in the Black Hills. The dates of when to do these things or the stuff we’d do in between was unsettled. It was novel for both of us to spend a vacation like this. Usually vacations were well planned out affairs so as to maximize the activities that were possible. Or even vacations whose purpose was relaxation there was still a known place and routine to the day. Here we had the true roadtrip experience: young, excited, and untethered.
        <br><br>
            We decided we’d try and hike the Castle Trail at Badlands National Park on Wednesday so we’d spend the rest of Monday and Tuesday toddling around Iowa and South Dakota. 9 holes of golf near Des Moines, a failed attempt at attending a 2020 presidential campaign event, a sightseeing stop at the Corn Palace in Mitchell SD and an active native american archeological site nearby, and a pit stop in Chamberlain South Dakota to try and fix Norman.
        <br><br>
            The fuze had still not been fixed, the driver side visor had a tendency to dislodge and fall down 10 inches into the face of the driver whenever we hit a big bump, and the hoods screws had become loose causing the whole hood to shake vigorously at high speeds. Chamberlain was a small town on the banks of the Missouri River, the longest river in North America, consisting of 20 or so businesses. Stop one, right in the center of town, the mechanic said he was sorry but he had a backlog of work that would take him into the following week. 2pm on a Tuesday in an all but forgotten town in South Dakota and the mechanic had a week worth of cars waiting?!? The mechanic was nice enough to recommend a place down the street, but warned that the older man there hated foureign cars and might refuse to work on my Hyundai. Rather excited to meet such a character we were disappointed and perplexed when we found his store closed for the day, at 2:15 on a Tuesday. Thwarted, we were headed out of town when Noah spotted a Napa Autoparts store and thought maybe they’d lend us the tools to do the fixes ourselves. MVP of the Dakotas, John, waiting for us behind the counter, showed us how to take the fuze out of the power connector box, sold us some gorilla glue for the visor, and lent us some wrenches needed for tightening the screws of the hood. It was a very satisfying feeling to do all of these small fixes, all for the mighty sum of $4.10. I felt capable. Handy. Having changed the oil and oil filter myself before the trip I felt like I was starting to get a grasp of how cars worked, something I had always wished I knew.

            “Sssssss”

            “AHHHHHH. HOLY SHIIIIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT. “

            “WAS THAT A RATTLESNAKE?” Noah asked after we had darted 20 yards back down the trail.

            “YEAH. It was fucking two feet away. I looked down and it was a foot in front of me and a foot off the trail.”
        <br><br>
            We had seen signs warning of rattlesnakes when we had signed into the Castle Trail log, but holy shit! this one was right there. 4.1 miles down the trail, the badlands starting on our left and the grasslands to our right, we were a bit stuck. For much of the hike the grasslands were relatively sparse, easy to traverse, here though it was thick with brambles; plus we weren't sure if there were other snakes hidden nearby. The badlands, made from a very crumbly clay like rock, were eroding 3 inches each year and were poor for hiking. Footholds and handholds were likely to crumble beneath one's weight. Thus with a steep 15 foot slide marking the start of the badlands formation just a couple of feet off the trail on our left, looping around the snake on either side seemed untenable. We tried throwing rocks next to it, stomping and yelling, and shooing it with Noah’s portable tripod, all to no avail. All we managed to accomplish was to make it coil up and hiss even louder. Not knowing how dangerous rattlesnakes are, but knowing they are venomous of some kind, we decided we didn't need to see the last mile of the trail and decided to turn around.
        <br><br>
            Still only 10:27 AM we had already had an eventful day. We had woken up at 5:45 to witness the sunrise, the golden rays illuminating the striated rocks layers which gave the badlands their character. One million years before all we would have seen was a gentle river flowing through grassland. 500,000 years from now and the erosion would be so complete that the jagged ridgelines and beautifully colored striations showing the rock layers would be gone, returning the land to gently rolling grassland. We had arrived at the perfect time to see the area at its most spectacular. The highest ridgelines 700ft up and the badlands extending for a 30 mile stretch, we could compare the relative ages of rock layers from two very separate sections all while the sun peeked over the horizon.
        <br><br>
            The only damper on the morning had been Noah’s new phone. An iphone 11 with three cameras on the back, a wide lens, portrait mode, and night mode included. I quickly realized that with my iphone 5 SE my photos were impotent. There was no point in me taking a picture if Noah was right there beside me taking the exact same shot. His would look so much better that after a bit I gave up trying, leaving my phone in my bag. For sunrise I was his assistant recommending new viewpoints and angles that I thought might be good. On the trail I wandered off into the outlying canyons of the badlands skidding and scurrying around as Noah paused and took professional quality pictures. What finally stopped all the picture taking was that damn snake. It scared the begegas out of us.
        <br><br>
            Noah took the lead on our way back, conversation all but ceased, our eyes focused downward on the lookout for other slithering reptiles. I was definitely skittish taking offense at every sound, but Noah tried to say he wasn't. However, he hilariously timed “I’m not scared.” with the takeoff of a couple of birds in the grass; their wing beats against the grass simulating the rattle of a rattlesnake shockingly well. Noah gave a yelp of freight and came running back up the trail like a scared Scooby Doo into the arms of Shaggy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Stopping by the visitor center on our way out we bombarded the rangers with questions accumulated on the trail.

            “How come there are some black sedimentary rocks interspersed in the runoff areas? They look very different than the crumbly rock of the badlands.”

            “You’re exactly right, they were brought down from the Black Hills all the way here by the river that eroded the badlands.”

            “How common are rattlesnake attacks?”

            “We have 5 or 6 every year.”

            “Are they deadly?”

            “Not usually for full grown adults. If you get treatment within the first 30 minutes you are usually okay. Longer than that and there can be some clotting of the blood caused by the venom, which can be dangerous.”

            “Are there any large animals in the park? We kept looking out and all the way to the horizon we couldn’t see a single one.”

            “Yeah there are more in the western section of the park we have a herd of 3,000 buffalo. Or rather bison. Some bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and black footed ferrets are also over there.”
        <br><br>
            Like magic, as we headed out of the park through the western entrance, a cluster of bighorn sheep crossed the road right in front of us. 250lbs, with massive horns curved back behind them in a semi-circle, the sheep clomped their way across the pavement, paying absolutely no need to the cars they were holding up. It was surreal being so close and made for a spectacular photo opportunity. Three male bighorn sheep grazing on the grass only a foot off the road, the badlands rising 300 feet directly behind them, clear blue sky up above that. We gawked, Noah took photos, and I repeated “Oh Wow, SO COOL!” way too many times.
        <br><br>
            Not five minutes down the road, we rounded a curve to see mammoth dark spots dotting a huge expanse of grassland. We pulled over onto a little dirt road to watch. The bison having shed their winter fir, only their front half had a thick mane of curly black hair, their backsides covered in a much thinner coat similar to that of a cow. Most were far off in the distance, their heads down in the grass, their chomping very audible. Yet there was one right near the road and he WAS COMING CLOSER. At 2,000 pounds it weighed far more than my little Hyundai Accent. We froze and the beast walked mere feet in front of us to go scratch on the yield sign. Back and forth it lurched, trying to itch its shoulder, the poor yield sign getting yanked to and fro, 15 degrees forwards, then 15 degrees backways.
        <br><br>
            Stoked with our luck, bighorn sheep and bison RIGHT ON THE ROAD! when we hadn’t seen a single other wild mammal all day, even from a distance, we happily started on our way up to North Dakota.

        <p>
            I’m not sure how to feel about the scenic drives which almost every National Park has. Often a loop, they are designed to give the automotive visitor a quick hits album of what the park has to offer. I wanted to hate them, black stains which have no place in the most pristine lands our country has left, yet I used them. They allowed me to see in a day what it would take a week of backpacking to see otherwise.
        <br><br>
            Theordore Roosevelt National Park had one of the nicer scenic drives. A 35 mile loop, closed in one section because the badlands underneath had eroded and collapsed the road, it had 5 numerous scenic stopping points.
        <br><br>
            Stop one, the prairie dog settlements. These badlands of North Dakota were much farther along in the erosion process. The ranger in the visitor center said they were the friendlier version of Badlands National Park, their curves more rounded and vegetation far more plentiful. All of which made TR NP the perfect habitat for prairie dogs. About one foot tall, looking like oversized hamsters, they were everywhere. The crumbly rock made it easy for them to bury their homes, the vegetation providing them a plentiful diet.
        <br><br>
            I rushed at them, sprinting hard for 15 yards directly at them. It felt a bit wrong, against the ethos of the National Parks, but a plaque detailing their different calls had made me too curious. A repeating yap when they spot danger, a jump and yip when the danger disappears, and many variations in between. “Prairie dogs have the most sophisticated vocal language ever decoded.” With most of their natural predators dead long ago we spent 10 minutes just watching them scurry about cropping the grass around their homes all to one inch tall. We weren’t going to see any of their language if we didn't do something. My mad dash was in the name of science! One popped up, not the closest but nearby, stood erect and gave a yelp, terrified of this rushing 165 pound man. All its neighbors heard the signal and scurried to their holes. This is how they survive. They keep their lawns short so predators can't sneak up, and they live in settlements by the thousands so there are always eyes on the lookout. The yelps kept coming, every two seconds. Then once I had backed up, back onto the road, the vocal prairie dog jumped up kicked its hind legs and yipped that all was safe again. Lawn mowing and neighborhood gossip resumed.
        <br><br>
            Stop two, Buck Hill, a knob from which two rangers with binoculars were pointing out wildlife in the distance. A pair of feral horses over there. A group of Elk so far in the distance they were barely even specs. All around us rounded butes with painted rock layers poking out between the grassy tops and wooded ravines. The Lakota people were the first to call this place "mako sica" or "land bad." French-Canadian fur trappers called it "les mauvais terres pour traverse," or "bad lands to travel through." Its crumbly and very uneven terrain with few water supplies made the land terrible for farming and treacherous to cross. Thus to the natives and early white settlers there were undesirable lands, especially in comparison to the flat grasslands we had driven through for four hours on our way here. As a result, this was some of the only virgin grassland in the country. The second most biodiverse ecosystem in the world, behind only the rainforest, the US had only 32% of its virgin grassland left. The rest has at some point or another been plowed under, agriculture, roads, or buildings, the main culprits. Looking straight down as we hiked the short nearby trail, I thought I could see the increased biodiversity. Maybe it's because I was looking for it, but any patch of ground I looked at was remarkably rich. Multiple types of grasses, including saltgrass, western wheatgrass, and needle-and-thread, creeping juniper creeping in patches, sagebrush making cameos, very young pine saplings poking up, and some lichen looking stuff very was near the ground and in-between everything.
        <br><br>
            Stop three, an exposed old coal vein. Coal inside the earth can catch fire and when it does it creates a ciln like environment that bakes the clayey soil of the badlands. The result was bright red patches of ground where arrowhead sized shards of pottery covered the surface. We did the loop and were quite impressed with the scope of the area. The red was so vibrant and it was wild imagining the earth smoldering below us. That said, we left feeling like we must have made a wrong turn, we only saw a few small patches, no big vein as was described on the trailhead.
        <br><br>
            Stop four, the eroded section of the scenic road. Along a curve around the side of a butte, the ground beneath had just given away taking the pavement with it. The road now fifteen feet below, left a large drainage pipe sticking out from the side of the butte. The ranger inside said the fix would cost $1,000,000, not something in budget for a Park Service three billion dollars short on maintenance work. It was remarkable to see, and yet more remarkable that it didn’t happen more often. After all, erosion is what happens in the badlands. It is the only constant. To build a road across such land seems like a sisyphean task. No matter what was done, the ground beneath the road would eventually wash away. It was not a question of if, but how often.
        <br><br>
            Stop five: We raced back to a point near the start of the loop where the Little Missouri made a horseshoe curve through a section of badlands. It was the best place to watch the sunset and we were losing light quickly. Around curve after curve we drummed up excitement for how great the scene would be. The light was perfect, as Noah would say “dynamic light”. We raced past beautiful pictures thinking better was upcoming. We parked, raced up the slope and oh my what a setting. On the left and right the striations of the badlands sloped up at a 60 degree angle, looking like stadium seating for the Little Mousori flowing below. Beneath us and curving to our right for a bit was a 150ft foot cliff that the river had carved colored white down near the shoreline and a thick stripe of yellow near the top. In the middle of the horseshoe a 1000ft by 1000ft expanse of grass with yellow and green shrubs interspersed. They say when settlers first came upon this scene the entire central area was black with bison. “Squeezed in shoulder to shoulder there looked to be no more room, and yet still they were streaming in by the thousands down the slope.” Back then there were 3 million bison in the United States. By the time Theodore Roosevelt was president the beasts numbered in the hundreds. Through the conservation efforts of TR and many others, they number 250,000 today; 25,000 on public lands and 225,000 in private herds. In our time in the park we saw maybe 75 of the estimated 25,000 on public lands!
        <br><br>
            As beautiful as the scene was, the sun had just dipped behind a bank of clouds on the horizon as we arrived ruining the national geographic moment. At the highest viewpoint along the cliff we met up with 10 or so other disappointed photographers. Set up with their $1,000+ cameras on tripods they were just standing around chatting, their fingers quivering from how many photos they’d taken in the previous hour. Now though, they waited, hoping the clouds would part and the sun would peak through for a final shot. We joined the gaggle and immediately they made us the center of attention. They were very happy to have two interested and unknowledgeable subjects, so we got a free 30 minute lesson on photography; the different telephoto lenses, how to frame the shot into thirds, how to not overexpose a scene, how some of the best shots happen after the sun goes down and the pink hues arrive so we should stick around, and on and on. They were all 50+. This was how they enjoyed the parks. Not up for hiking or backpacking, photography was their outlet. One man, 60, had lived 56 of his years in ND, and was spending his retirement driving around and photographing the national parks. “If I never go east of the Mississippi again I’ll be okay, all the good stuff is out here west of it.”
        <br><br>
            Driving out of Theordore Roosevent, Noah and I discussed which park we had liked more. “I understand why TR came here to heal, it was so pastoral. It just felt like such a friendly place to be,” Noah remarked. “Yeah so peaceful, imagine riding a horse over all those hills, Bison and Elk all over the place.” Theodore Roosevelt had come out here to Medora, ND to heal after his mother and wife died on the same day back in New York. He became a cattle ranger and an assistant sheriff. He hunted, he healed, and he gained a new perspective on life. “If I had never gone out to ND, I would never have become President.” “Badlands was obviously stunning and better for photos, but it was such a harsh environment. I liked TR much more. It was just inherently pleasant on the eye. I could have sat there at Wind Canyon and just looked out for hours,” Noah said. “Yeah, Badlands was more spectacular, but I really want to come back here and spend the week, camping out and hiking around. Whereas I don't feel the need to go back to Badlands,” I responded.

            I dropped Noah off at the Rapid City airport midday on Saturday after a quick morning nine. We’d spent the previous day craning our necks to see Mt. Rushmore and doing a very picturesque hike in Custer State Park. It had been a fantastic week. We’d both been accommodating of each others itinerary desires, had many political and historical debates, and had gotten incredibly fortunate with the wildlife we’d seen. No lions, tigers, or bears, but bighorn sheep, bison, feral horses, rattlesnakes, elk, deer, prairie dogs, squirrels, chipmunks, and birds, birds, birds, oh my!
        <br><br>
            That said, for some reason I was somewhat glad to be back by myself. I was looking forward to putting on my audiobook and driving alone across a lonely landscape.

            As the old man back on Lee St warned I was expecting Nebraska to be mind numbingly boring; Mile after mile of endless grassland as far as the eye could see. It was exactly that, all the way to the horizon in every direction, nothing but monocolor golden grass. But I absolutely loved it! Its immensity was mind warping. Rather than being flat there were rolling hills, huge swales, and elevated flats. Thus there were times when you'd be cresting a slope and have a vantage from where you could see for miles. These were the great plains. No farming was being done, no cattle were grazing, no trees or bushes, no windmills were capturing the howling wind, grass was all there was. It was like rooting for an underdog that wins, the beauty of the scenery was a complete surprise and I fell for it all the more because of it. For the next couple days all I wanted to talk about was how much I loved driving through Nebraska.

            South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado. The six hour drive felt like nothing and I made great time. Beating Madison and Charlotte to our dinner spot in Boulder, I walked around its very crunchy main street; Patagonia, North Face, REI, and all the other outdoorsy stores concentrated in this four block stretch. They surprised me as I was walking out of Patagonia, we hugged happy to see each other, ate quickly, transfered my camping stuff into Charlottes car, and headed off into the Rocky Mountains. I had proposed the idea of camping out Saturday night and hiking Sunday and they both jumped at the idea. The forecast didn't look good but we were gungho. Campgrounds in Rocky Mountains National Park were closed this late in the season, but camping in the National Forests is always permitted. Winding our way into the mountains at 25mph, be terribly nauseous in the back row, as we made our way to Arapaho National Forest. One hour later we had our spot picked out, and were using the lights of Charlotte’s car to illuminate the ground as we set up the tent. Too tired to put up both tents, we all piled like sardines into Madison’s two person tent. We joked and laughed and talked about their recent moves from Boston out to Denver, and stayed up way too late as the sunrise would wake us up by 7. In the morning I looked up to see a thick coating of powder on the rain cover, four inches of snow having fallen during the night, and two girls on either side of me naked in their sleeping bags having overheated during the night in the cramped quarters.
        <br><br>
            It was cold. 18 degrees with a blustery wind, we had caught a tough break. At the trailhead the wind was blowing so hard it was difficult to open our car doors; the snow swirling outside looked like dust after a helicopter departs, defying gravity and flying upwards. Lacking my winter coats, I put on multiple layers of shirts under my sweatshirt. I was frozen within the first 30 seconds. Fortunately, the girls were too, and we made it only half a mile up the trail before turning around.
        <br><br>
            We tumbled back into the car and drove down hoping the weather was better at a lower elevation. Sure enough it was 53 degrees with that same howling wind down at Mt. Sanitas just outside Boulder. We had a lovely hike, with great views of the flatirons, Boulder, and Denver off in the distance.
        <br><br>
            That is something I would come to learn about Denver. It was surprisingly warm in the city, but just an hour away a winter wonderland awaited. In December and January the average temperature was 47 degrees in Denver, yet some of the best skiing in the world was right next door.

            It seems like everyone who goes vegan has a reason for it. It would be quite unusual for an omnivore in a bountiful land to just happen upon no meat, no dairy. Madison and her roommate Julia are for environmental reasons. Charlotte is vegan most of the time for a combination of environmental reasons and peer pressure, but charmingly scarfs fish down when the timing is right.
        <br><br>
            At that first meal in Boulder, Madison and Charlotte were discussing sharing a few vegan dishes which sounded good, and I decided then that it would be a fun experiment for the week. Beet salad, roasted brussel sprouts, and tempeh with sweet potato puree and roasted chickpeas, greeted us that first night. I kept with it meal after meal, all week. Seitan Buffalo wings, quinoa bowl, vegan hummus plate with baba ganoush, impossible burger, fried cauliflower chicken, mac and ‘cheese’, and to top it off, carrot dogs - a boiled carrot inside a whole wheat bun with all the fixings.
        <br><br>
            It added some intrigue to an otherwise subdued visit. I was back at work, working 8-4 and a bit exhausted from the week in the Dakotas. I was totally happy to go with the flow, hang around, and eat. We prepared for their upcoming halloween party, showed up to trivia late and drank at a nearby brewery instead, but mostly we ate. It was fun being part of the gang when we were ordering, rather than being the lone meat eater. I even enjoyed the food, at least most of it. I couldn’t get behind the fake meat. A well prepared quinoa bowl or beet salad and I was all about it. Vegetables and fruits have always been super tasty. Fruits after all are evolutionarily designed to taste good. But the seitan buffalo wings had a rubbery texture that made them look and taste like the moon food you might buy as a souvenir at the Air and Space Museum. And the whole plant based burgers make no sense to me. Talk about processed food! They have 40+ ingredients.
        <br><br>
            That said, after a week of being vegan I could feel myself bumping up against the limitations. It was always a struggle to find vegan breakfast or lunch options that weren’t salads. So it made sense when Julia said “after a while of being vegan you are looking for something different, and so people like the variety of fake meat.” From a business perspective that definitely seemed true. We went to some vegan only restaurants, which Denver has many of, and they were all packed with fake meat enthusiasts.

            Besides all the baby calves and chickens who were spared, the most important happening of the week was the arrival of my suit bag and all my winter jackets. Back in Buffalo I had called Travis the morning after discovering the disappearance and asked him to put up some MISSING posters. He said yes, but was particularly slow about putting them up. He presumed it was a lost cause so he enjoyed his weekend before putting up some posters on Lee St. Sunday evening.
        <br><br>
            Winter jackets are not cheap! So I was overjoyed when I woke up at that Super 8 motel in South Bend Indiana, trudged, eyes all but closed, to spoon cereal into my mouth, and got a call from a resident of 12 Lee St. who said the bag was on their porch downstairs. Throughout the five hour drive to Cedar Rapids I got texts from three other people! saying that the bag was safely on the porch. Jeremy, an energy trader, who works three or four 12 hour shifts per week, had the day off and was enthusiastic about helping. He went over to Lee, picked up the bag, and walked it over to the Cambridge Post Office to ship it to Madison’s House. $64.67 ground shipping to Denver and it was expected to arrive on the Monday of my visit.

            It was late. Day after day I wore the same sweatshirt, worrying about the sub-zero temperatures in the forecast for Jackson Wyoming. Monday passed. Tuesday passed. I was leaving Thursday after work. Wednesday afternoon around 5pm Christmas came early! A “tragedy” turned into a comedy.

            America’s Least Value Inn. $64.99 per night but ripped comforters, harsh lighting, and inept wifi included. Having work starting at 8:10 and the room already purchased I googled Cafe’s in Rawlins Wyoming. The closest internet cafe was Starbucks two hours north in Lander Wy. My plan was to get on the road by 6, if I was late and needed to take my morning call from the road no one would be any the wiser as long as I was online by 8:30, 10:30 eastern. I executed the departure, leaving a little before 6, and progress was good until the sun started peeking over the horizon. It would have been criminal not to stop and try to capture the scene. Grasslands spreading to the distant mountains, the sun poking through some wispy clouds creating texture and variance to the glow. I made a few stops, each time the scene improved enough to demand another photo. 7:30 rolls around and my phone loses service 50 minutes minutes from Lander. Not being at my computer isnt a disaster, but missing the meeting would create some serious side-eye, especially this week, my first week actually working remotely. I floor it, pushing Norman over 90mph, fear tightening my throat. Each passing minute, still no service. Hill after hill, civilization nowhere in sight, excuses flying through my head, none of them holding more than a drop of credibility. 7:40, 7:50, 8:00, Wyoming flying by, the beauty of the scenery now going unnoticed. 1x pops up on my screen, followed shortly by 3G. I couldn’t believe my luck, I was still out of sight from any town, no identifiable change in location, 8:06 on the clock. It took the phone a few seconds to start ringing, but miraculously connected. So, so lucky. The call dropped over the next hill though. 3G returned soon thereafter but no matter if I stopped moving or kept driving the call kept failing after 10 or so seconds. 15 more tries later I arrive in Lander at 8:36, the stoppages from trying to hold service causing some extra delays. Grimacing as I opened my computer, I still had no excuse. If only I had picked a better hotel I could have worked from Rawlins. If I’d not stopped to take those photos I could have gotten to Lander in time. If I’d thought that I might lose service I could easily have left earlier.

            You come to learn that parked cars on the shoulder indicate wildlife is likely close. One car and it might be nothing or a passing dear. Five cars and you have bison, elk, or bighorn sheep.  Fifteen and you have a grizzly. Driving from Lander through the Togwotee Pass enroute to Jackson a hub of commotion confronted me. So many cars, it was difficult to parallel park on the shoulder of a US highway! 30 people were stationed looking over the railing. I was extremely curious to see what could possibly creating such a fuss. A momma and her young cub were 30 yards down the bank lounging in the early season snow. Felecia had been relocated here in 2016 after being deemed too close to civilization, and had since made her home right there near US Highway 26, often crossing the road multiple times during her days meandering. The photographers had been at this spot just as long. Following Felecia year after year they learned her personality and her habits. In the process they had gotten to know each other too, spending day after day watching and waiting together. Now they had a new personality to learn. Pepper had been born in the den early that year and was now the size of a duffle bag. She'd had an eventful year. Seperated from her mother for a month during the summer, she had been written off by researchers and onlookers. She survived off the early season grasses and the occasional small rodent. Reconnected now she looked carefree resting her head on her mother's belly. I spent an hour with them, watching their minute movements and chatting with the photographers.
        <br><br>
            The photographers, each sporting a telephoto lens six to eighteen inches long, were positioned in a line just over the railing pointing their lenses at the two grizzlies. Capable of taking 100 photos per second, the cameras created a machine gunfire signal to a distracted chattler like myself that it was time to look. And yet not much happened. Only once did they get up on all four legs only to return back to their reclined positions moments later. Yet each scratch or affectionate touch of mother and cub would produce squeals of delight and a ripple of shutters down the line.
        <br><br>
            “Sometimes Otters, or Bison, or Elk, but most days we spend up here. We are bear people. They just have so much more personality.” Day after day, hour after hour after hour after hour, they watched the lives of these two. I got an acute thrill seeing any new animal on the trip, but to watch the same creature so intensely felt like vicarious living.
        <br><br>
            With the two showing no signs of action and the sun setting over the Tetons I bid farewell to my new friends and headed down the road. Variety beckoned.

            BEAR ATTACK!
        <br><br>
            Are you prepared to avoid one?
        <br><br>
            Avoid hiking alone. If a bear attacks during a surprise encounter, play dead. If the bear persistently stalks you then attacks - fight back!
        <br><br>
            A nice greeting as I started my 10 mile solo hike up Death Canyon in Grand Teton National Park. If I had kept my head in the sand the previous two days I wouldn’t have batted an eye at this sign, thinking such sightings were so rare there was nothing to actually concern myself with. Instead all I had been hearing since arriving in Wyoming was bear, bear, bear. There was the grizzlies sighting on Togwotee Pass. There was Sam, my host, telling me all his bear run ins and that I needed bear spray. There were the reviews on alltrails.com where every other reviewer claimed to have turned around because a bear was on this trail. And finally there was this sign, whose headline at first made me think there had been a bear attack in the area recently. All told, I was spooked.
        <br><br>
            I have quite the imagination, and sometimes it gets the best of me. When I was 11, my parents left the house early and I had an hour alone before I was to talk the 9 blocks to school. I started running through my options if burglars were breaking in. Home Alone was my favorite movie and I was playing my own version of it. Boobie traps, weapons, hiding spots, all were conjured to mind. In the bathroom? They would absolutely find me. Under the bed? Who doesn’t look there. But oh, my closet, without a doorknob once closed a screwdriver was needed to open it. At this point I had convinced myself they were coming upstairs at that very moment, so I pushed my way into the overflowing closet, creating just enough space for my body, face up against the door. Then I closed the door until there was just a sliver of light shining through. They would probably open the door if it was ajar though. So I pulled on the door a tad more until it clicked closed. That's when my brain switched back on and I knew I was in trouble. I needed that same screwdriver that was in the kitchen to wedge it in the hole left by the knob and turn the latch. I had also managed to leave my Motorola flip phone on the table 4 feet the other side of the door. I tried rummaging around in the pitch dark closet for something else that would turn the latch. A pencil, a rolled up manilla folder, my finger, old soccer trophies. No luck, I was officially stuck. I started screaming, hoping the workers in the apartment above would hear and come to my rescue. I tried to break down the door, pushing against the mountain of stuff with my back I pushed against the door with my feet, bowing the door outwards. Some serious movement, but the door stayed shut. Exhausted, hopeless, and crying, I feel asleep almost vertically. Upon waking up I tried breaking down the door with increased vigor; bowing out the door six inches. CRASH. The mirror on the far side of the door cracked and crashed to the floor. My father happened to be back at home after a morning meeting, came running in, opened the door, and found a puddle of a son. A shower later I was sent for an afternoon of school.
        <br><br>
            My imagination started rolling here as well. Having tried to get to the trailhead by way of the dirt road and finding it too rutted and treacherous for Norman, I parked at the end of the paved section and walked the mile to the trailhead instead. A light snow was falling, giving the feel of winter even in late October. Temperatures were hovering around freezing as they would all week and at 6,000 feet there was already a few inches of snow on the ground. An 8 mile trail, plus the two for getting to and from the trailhead, and I had a full afternoon ahead. I’d been wanting to hike and listen to my Theodore Roosevent audiobook, but quickly thought better of that as your ears are your most perceptive sense out here.
        <br><br>
            Thus chomp, chomp, chomp, the occasional bird and the wind were all that broke the quiet. That gave all the more territory for my mind to roam. Looking for something to occupy itself with, my mind started playing out beat attacks in my head; a surprise encounter; a grizzly stalking me and then attacking; spraying the bear spray upwind and debilitating myself instead; attacking back with a rock and winning; running downhill so that the bear would tumble over its short front arms and roll past me. Five hours gives you a long time to run through scenarios. Plus, with this early snow bears might be desperate to pack in some extra calories before hibernation.
        <br><br>
            Up 800 feet, back down, and now I was entering the woods at the base of the creek. 1,500 feet up from there to the cabin which marked the turnaround spot. Dense trees loomed ahead and I gave out a little whistle to warn any would be bears of my arrival. If a bear stalked and attacked what could I really do, so I tried to remove the possibility of a surprise encounter. I got into a routine with it; whistle, hike, stare at the rock faces rising up into the clouds on each side of the trail, whistle again. Halfway up the trail large rock slides created perfect bear dens so I added a louder whoop to my arsenal. Whistle, hike, look at the cascading stream cutting its way through the canyon, whoop loudly, repeat. The snow was falling so beautifully, each flake floating down ever so slowly, the hike strenuous and beautiful. I was having a lovely, if frightened time. Through the woods, back and forth along the switchbacks to the base of the rock wall on the right, and up into the high meadows where the wood cabin was nestled.
        <br><br>
            I took a peak around, had a staring contest with a squirrel and headed back down. It was 4:16pm, a little less than three hours after I’d started, and sunset was at 6:04pm. No time to lollygag, light was fading fast. Ice was forming on the trail as the temperature was dropping so I was slipping and sliding as I hurried back down the trail. Focusing my eyes downward on my footing, I was also on the lookout for any tacks on the trail which were fresher than my uphill footprints. The snow, still falling, was providing an excellent timing mechanism for any animal tracks. About a third of the way down I almost slid into a fresh turd on the trail, which I could only assume was bear. My reaction was to double down on my whooping and whistling, increasing the volume and frequency of both. Alone on the trail, not seeing another hiker all day, I didn’t care how foolish I sounded. I was fully aware of how annoying I must have been though and thought to myself how fair it would be for a bear to off me just to get some peace and quiet.
        <br><br>
            I got distracted tracing rabbit, squirrel, and fox tracks as they darted across and down the path, until about four fifths of the way down the trail a tree swayed and a growell came from the depths. I darted back up the trail 50 yards and surveyed my surroundings. Bear spray in hand and whoops spewing out, I proceeded slowly down the trail with my head on a swivel. No sign of what I had heard appeared though. 10 minutes later I arrived back at Norman, just as the last whispers of light were being exhausted, 6:42 on the clock.

            An Idaho Hoedown was on the docket that night. Some friends Sam somewhat knew had invited us to a Halloween party at a lodge somewhere in Idaho. Sam didn't have an address, but based on google maps satellite view, was somewhat confident he knew where it was. Up over the mountain pass to Idaho, one car flipped over on its side due to ice on the roads cop car next to it, we made our way. As we pulled in, the setting was everything that could be imagined. An old ski lodge, which had since been taken over by the school department and rented out for $100 per day on the weekends, in a completely empty part of an already sparsely populated Idaho, with a clear sky and the full Milky Way visible above. The music had been turned down low as we walked in because the costume competition was being judged. Unlike Boston Halloween, this was an all in affair, with elaborate costumes the norm. A dragon with homemade flashing wings. A dominatrix and her boyfriend who was leashed and on rollerblades, both flashed the crowd at the end of their dance routines in case that would win any favor from the judges. A man who had an entire weather system floating from an umbrella above his head. And the eventual winner, a naughty Winnie the Pooh, decked out with a homemade honeypot and skimpy booty shorts.
        <br><br>
            The competition over, the DJ put his large setup to full use, and all 50 people started dancing. Firepit in the center of the dancefloor, bunk beds for 30+ upstairs, bonfire outside, a commercial kitchen with snacks set up, it was an incredible deal for $100. About halfway through the evening everything kicked up a notch when rollerblades appeared in all different sizes and we proceeded to congo line our way in circles are the lodge. We hadn’t know what we were getting ourselves into, Sam having very little idea of what this was going to be, but it was nothing short of the most fun Halloween party I’ve ever been to. The bonfire raged, the DJ played as loudly as he wanted, and we danced around on our roller skates until the wee hours.

            Absolutely crushing news as we awoke Sunday morning, the crown jewel of the trip would be missed. Closing for the season the next weekend, Nov. 4, the roads were currently closed due to the heavy snowfall Saturday. I had dreams of watching the wolves in Lamar Valley, hearing my echo in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and watching the geysers of gods laboratory. Yellowstone was the first stop marked down and now I would have to drive on without seeing it. A two hour drive each way from Jackson, plus the time actually in the park, it would have been difficult to fit in on a single weekend day, much less midweek. Plus with three of my code changes being released the upcoming week, and it being my second week working remotely, it would be poor form to take a day off. If that wasn’t enough, the roads were closed indefinitely, no guarantee they would be cleared before the end of the season with a cold week in the forecast.
        <br><br>
            Negative five degrees when I walked outside Tuesday morning, high of 31 for the week. I plugged away at work trying to crank these three projects out the door. Thursday rolls around, a blue bird day, and I have two of three merged in and the third just waiting for its required approvals. Log off at 2pm, 4pm eastern time, drive two hours north, see the major hits, Old Faithful, the Prismatic Lakes, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, hopefully some wildlife along the way, and drive back when it is totally dark around 7pm. At least that was the plan.
        <br><br>
            “Snow Tires are required on all park roads.” A friendly park ranger informed me at the south gate.
        <br><br>
            “Yep, no problem. Thank You!”
        <br><br>
            The bluebird day in Jackson had turned into a semi-serious snow storm at the gates of Yellowstone. The roads were a bit icy but this was my only shot at Yellowstone. Two wheel drive and two year old tires be damned. I tested my brakes every once in a while and they seemed up to the task so I drove on through the low visibility snowfall. On either side of me I saw hints of beauty; a river plunging through a 40ft canyon, Yellowstone Lake whipping with wind, rolling hills speckled with conifers. But no more than 50ft of visibility was possible.
        <br><br>
            Old Faithful had received its name for being the most predictable of the geysers. Park rangers were able to predict within a 90 percent likelihood the 20 minute window when it would next explode. It being 4:30 and the next prediction at 5:45, +- 10 minutes when I arrived, I drove on, up to the prismatic lakes. Billowing with steam it looked like hell was burning through the earth's crust as the gases from its noxious cauldrons floated up into this majestic winter tundra. Engulfing me with sauna thick steam the views of the prismatic lakes and their vibrant colors were almost wholly obstructed. A strong winter breeze sometimes blew away enough to catch a quick glimpse at the side of the formation. 400 degrees and miles deep, the lakes produce nutrient rich water which spills down over the flats and down into the river below. Along the way rich mats of microbiomes pick off the nutrients and energy from the rapidly cooling water to form orange and red streaks with the grain of the streaks going with the flow of the water.
        <br><br>
            A disappointment from a color perspective, it was very cool to see the billowing smoke from all the different hot spots covering the valley as the ground and sky were covered in snow. It was especially cool seeing a few bison munching near a stream with smoke holes billowing around them, imagining the stories of Bison falling through a soft spot in the terrain and being boiled alive in the hot springs below. One of the first published accounts from Yellowstone talked about catching a fish in a cold spot and cooking it in a hot spot not more than five feet away. Here I could see how many places that would have been possible.
        <br><br>
            5:35 and I was in position at Old Faithful. It was a bit late, at 5:53 spewing water 25ft up into the air and steam billowing up hundreds of feet higher. I was entertained but not fully engaged. My mind was worried about the snow and my drive home. On the 10 minute drive from the Prismatic Lakes to Old Faithful my tires spun excessively in the snow, having trouble gaining traction and accelerating. Then just as I was arriving at Old Faithful and trying to make a left turn into the parking lot I fishtailed out of control, ending up perpendicular to the lane I was trying to turn into. I was going only 15mph. How was I going to fare on the drive back? It would require speed to make it up the hills and then I would have trouble staying in control coming down at those speeds.
        <br><br>
            When I got back to the car I got down on my hands and knees and tried to brush out all the snow which was packed into the grooves of my tires. Even still driving didn’t feel great, but I was managing okay. Then five miles back towards Jackson I was confronted with a road closed barricade. Craig Pass and the direct path back to Jackson was closed due to the snow. Every lodge and campground in the park had closed at least a week earlier. Plus I had to get back. Stupidly I hadn’t brought my computer so if I wasn’t able to make it back by our 8am meeting the next day I would be in a very bad spot. Looking at my Yellowstone App I saw the only road still open was up through the Western Entrance, out into Idaho, and then down a couple hours to Jackson. In good conditions it was predicted to be a 3.5 hour journey. What choice did I have though? I had to give it a try.
        <br><br>
            Gripping the steering wheel tightly, sitting up in my seat, and peering out intently for any crossing wildlife, I drove over the snowy paths of Yellowstone. Treacherous at first and then down in elevation to the dry and manageable roads of Idaho. Along the way I saw streak after streak of red. Dark in a spot and smearing out for the next ten feet or so, they signaled the untold deaths experienced at the hands of automobiles. With the greater Yellowstone ecosystem encompassing a much larger area than just the park, animals are forced to cross roads with drivers going 70mph on dark unlit roads. Tragedy was inevitable. Streak after streak, nowhere on the trip came close to the paint job of these Idaho roads; as many streaks on the road this week as the rest of my trip combined. A deer and a fox were close on this night, but both managed to elude my headlights by a couple of feet each time.
        <br><br>
            I got pulled over at the very end of the drive going 47mph in a 35 on some abandoned Idaho highway, but other than that I emerged unscathed from quite a Thursday adventure. It was a Halloween to remember.

            I left Friday afternoon with 14.5 hours to San Francisco. It is a fairly straight shot from Wyoming; across to Idaho, down into Utah, and then directly southwest through Nevada and into California. It was a pretty standard drive, fast and beautiful. The golden grasslands of Wyoming and Idaho giving way to the scrubby desert of Nevada, mountains continuously rimming the horizon. I slept in Elko Nevada friday night, a small strip of a town along I-80, got pulled over for speeding within a half mile of getting back on the highway Saturday morning, filled up at a gas station near Reno which doubled as a shockingly popular stripmall casino, and had my breath taken away by the beauty of Tahoe.
        <br><br>
            I got distracted flipping off some teenagers in a Jeep who were zigzagging through traffic on some winding mountain roads. When I looked up, Tahoe Lake, the sun glinting off its deep blue water, visible to me through a V formed by two pine covered slopes. It was just a peak, but it was absolutely stunning. I remember so vividly that drive down, bombing rather recklessly around the curves, the beauty of each sneak peak seared into my memory.
        <br><br>
            I pulled over at Logan Shoals Vista Point, about 300ft above the lake. Cinnamon trunked pine trees 150ft tall, massive granite boulders, pine cones the size of footballs, and that water!! So crystal clear it was possible to see 24ft deep. I climbed all the way down to the water's edge and out onto the last protruding rock. 65 degrees, not a cloud in the sky, the sun warming me and the rock, it was the most peaceful I have ever felt. Looking down into the water it was possible to see each and every boulder 50ft out from shore. It was a totally different experience than any body of water I’d ever seen, so clear and almost completely still. No longer did you have to guess where the fish were, you could see every minnow, trout, or salmon, swimming in your vicinity.
        <br><br>
            I sat there and I sat there, the lake was so still, it calmed my breath and my mind. I contemplated life, how it was possible Tahoe Lake contained enough water to cover California with 14” deep, but mostly I just stared out in a bit of a transe. I understood why this was the coveted retreat of the rich. The dense green of the shores the only break between the deep blue of the water and light blue of the sky. I never wanted to leave. It was the most beautiful place I saw that was not designated a National Park.
        <br><br>
            Turning back towards land I saw boulder after boulder all the way back up to the car. The ground is LAVA!!! Only the boulders were safe. Scrambling up some, plotting my way around the sides of others, and climbing straight up and over most, I had an absolute blast; I felt like a kid, with all the decision power of an adult. Taking routes a parent would scold for being too risky I thought “this is the best part of being an adult. You get to decide your own fun,” as I jumped the five foot span created by a walking path. Up the 300ft climb and atop the tallest boulder staring out at the Lake, I almost walked down and did it again it had been such a good time. I was now absolutely stoked to go outdoor climbing with Isabel’s friend Sabina the upcoming weekend.

        <p>
            The rest of the way to the Bay was uneventful; I left Tahoe around 4:30pm and arrived at Acorn’s in El Cerrito, a suburb in East Bay, at around 7:30pm on Saturday evening. Aaron Corn, thus the obvious nickname Acorn, was on the golf team with me at Tufts, and was now doing Teach For America in Oakland’s Deep East. The original plan had been to leave Boston earlier and spend a month or two at Acorn’s. Now it had been cut down to a little more than two weeks.
        <br><br>
            I was stoked to see Acorn, and him me. I dropped off my stuff, said whaddup to his roommates I’d met once before, and we took a little drive to get dinner. Acorn took me to his favorite, El Mano, a peruvian restaurant and ordered us two Lomo Saltado’s with chicken. Apparently a beloved peruvian dish, it was chicken stir fried with onions, tomatoes, cilantro and soy sauce, served on a bed of jasmine rice and french fries. The french fries were an odd touch, but very tasty. Unfortunately it turned out to be our last true meal together for my entire visit.
        <br><br>
            Acorn has OCD regarding his health and my visit sadly coincided with a bad bout of it. After a round of failed antibiotics, he was worried that the infection might spread to his kidneys, a condition called Pyelonephritis. The worry combined with him feeling piss poor and the effort of having to teach rowdy sixth graders math for eight hours per day, meant Acorn was out of commission for after work activities.

            I was annoyed for the first couple days, wanting to spend time with my pal, but after I came to terms with the situation, there was no animus between us, we just did our separate things. Up at 7 for work, I would be finished work by 3, and have tons of time for activities. A few days I played 9 holes at Tilden Park Golf Course, and a couple others I met up for dinner with other friends in the Bay Area, but mostly I toured the sights solo. I did a night tour of Alcatraz, I saw The Irishman at The Castro, I walked the Mission, Chinatown, Oakland, and Berkeley neighborhoods, and did much thrift shopping along the way.
        <br><br>
            These are a few snapshots from those meanderings.
        <br><br>
            At first it looked like an abandoned storefront. The single story building had peeling paint, markedly unclear windows, and an unbelievable clutter inside. On second inspection my eyes picked up that all the clutter was bikes and bike parts. It looked like they had been thrown in there until there was matter stacked six feet high. It reminded me of a NYC apartment closet where you open the door, stuff the latest thing in the first available spot and shut the door in a flash so to avoid an avalanche of stuff pouring out. It was a big storefront too, maybe 40ft by 40ft, thousands of bikes stuffed in to make an ocean of metal and rubber.
        <br><br>
            As I got to the corner of the block I looked into the front door, cut on a 45 degree angle, and saw an old disheveled looking white guy in his 60s sitting on a 1970s rolling office chair acting as gatekeeper of the clutter.
        <br><br>
            “Got any bikes for sale?”
            “I got a bunch of bikes, what are you looking for?”
            “A $100 cruising bike, for riding around town.”
            “I got this one out here $139, but we could work out a deal.”
        <br><br>
            Standing laboriously he pointed out a black mountain bike toppled on a few other bikes just outside the door. Besides from an unbelievably rusty chain the bike felt pretty solid riding around. I was thinking about buying one as a gift for Acorn, who didn’t have one.
        <br><br>
            “Unfortunately, I have my car here and don't have cash, but I’ll come back because I like the bike.”
            “Are you sure we can’t make a deal right now? I could throw in a lock.” Gesturing that there were plenty of locks available in the clutter.
            “Yeah, I wouldn’t be able to fit it in my car unfortunately. It’s a small two door. Thank you though.”
        <br><br>
            Most unfortunately Acorn said he probably wouldn't ride it if I got it, so I never got to go back and haggle with the old man on the price.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
            Berkeley Bowl, a supermarket, is a worthy tourist attraction. Located near where I found a parking spot, a little ways down the street from downtown Berkely, it did not disappoint. The theory that our sense of beauty is tied to settings and people which hold the promise of health and fertility proved true at Berkeley Bowl. Row after row of produce of every variety greets one's eyes upon arrival. A good local supermarket has pineapple, persimmon, and turnips, the fringe produce items. Berkeley Bowl has all of those items in four or five varieties. Large “Chestnut Hill” Pineapples from Costa Rica, Medium “Dole” Pineapples from Hawaii, X-Large “Del Monte” Pineapples from Costa Rica, Medium “Del Monte” Honeyglow Pineapples from Costa Rica. A whole bank of root vegetables: every color of carrots and turnips, celery root, purple kohlrabi, rutabagas, white Lobok Daikon. Dried pears, persimmons, and white peaches were some of the unusual dried goods. It was almost like an agricultural museum, where you can see the variety of bounty produced on this planet.
        <br><br>
            The most remarkable thing about Berkeley Bowl was the feel of the place; totally homey, like your own mother had done the design and branding. With only two locations, none of the efficient management and mass appeal branding of a Whole Foods or Central Market permeates the space. I walked in a bit bemused that lists had thought a supermarket was a top sight, but I walked out a convert, educated in the possible beauty of a supermarket.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
            I have a rule that I can buy basically whatever I want at the supermarket, honeycrisp apples, steak, ben and jerrys, because expensive supermarket food is way cheaper than eating out. I thought that rule should apply to thrift shops as well, but the thrift shops of California pushed that rule to its limit. Maybe because there is so much wealth in the bay area, or maybe SF’s rule banning chain stores allows for more local thrift shops to survive, I am not sure. All I know is that they are out of control good. At one thrift shop I found basically new all birds for $28!! I found that on my walking tours I was poking my head into each and every one just to make sure I wasn’t missing any gems.
        <br><br>
            The idea is that you will spend less in the long term by avoiding eating out or buying big ticket clothing items, but the quality of these thrift shops was  making me into a fashionista. Satiated hunger provides an upper limit on how much food I wanted, but at these prices and this quality, my demand for clothes felt infinite. A green canvas coat with tons of pockets, a few short sleeve button downs, those all birds which just happened to be in my size, and a patagonia sweatshirt all found their way into my luggage.

            The experiencing self and remembering self are often different people, but never have they been as bi-polar as the weekend Isabel visited me in SF. The experiencing self was a crab apple. Happy to see Isabel but very cranky with how the weekend was playing out. This was my one weekend to see SF and I was hoping for a jam-packed itinerary. However, at the behest of Isabel’s very nice friend Sabina we were to stay at Sabina’s and she would be our tour guide. An SF unicorn, a term meaning a kid who had actually been born and raised in SF proper, we thought Sabina would be a fantastic tour guide. And she was, but her pacing drove me crazy. The day before we would discuss big plans that required an early start, only to wake up early and laze around the house all morning. In a vacuum they were very nice mornings. On the top floor of a three floor townhouse in Nob Hill, we would make breakfast, chat with her housemates, and look out the window at the fog rolling by. For me, sitting by the window, looking out, it felt like detention, eyeing a world of forbidden possibilities. Isabel wasn’t about to be rude and up and leave before Sabina was ready, thus if I wanted to get an early start on the day I would have to leave Isabel; not a nice thing to do to a person who had just flown across the country to see you. Thus I was grounded, jittery and irritable by the window as life passed on by. My blood felt like it was simmering, getting close to losing all orderly form. There I sat, imagining all the SF things I had literally driven cross country to see and was now going to miss.
        <br><br>
            On top of that stew was the fact that Sabina loved Isabel so much that it often felt like I was the third wheel. Sabina would always face Isabel when she was talking and would focus the conversation towards her. At stores she made Isabel try this on or check out that, and I would be left to wander around by myself.  It felt as if Sabina was nice to me, but only because Isabel cared about me. If instead I wasn’t around, then all the merrier because she would have more ‘Bell’ time.
        <br><br>
            I remember those were the active feelings during the weekend, but now I think back on some of the best experiences of the trip and how generous a host Sabina was.
        <br><br>
            On Friday Sabina and her housemates threw a party they’d been wanting to have for a while, in honor of our visit. There we hobnobbed with civil engineers, structural engineers, and the techies which are said to be over ruining the city. It was fascinating to talk with the engineers about how the sandy soil of SF creates headaches for them as they try to build vertically and about the new technologies going into making buildings earthquake resistant. There were also plenty of Peppermint Patty Shots to go around, and a beautiful rooftop from which you could see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the TransAmerica building.
        <br><br>
            Saturday afternoon we strolled down to the Ferry Building at the bottom of Market Street. It felt like the old capitol building, with much of the city laid out to drive focus to it. Completed in 1898 it used to be the second largest transportation hub in the world behind London's Charing Cross Station. Peaking at 50,000 commuters per day, it was SF’s connection to the world until the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge’s were completed in the 1930s. Then the automobile, the Embarcadero Freeway, and a newly built train station called the Transbay Terminal, cast the Ferry Building into disrepair. From the 1950’s until its demolition in 1991, the Embarcadero Freeway, another name for Interstate-480, was a double decker highway crossing right across the face of the Ferry Building casting it in constant shadow. It was a testament to the era of highwaymen carving up American cities, holding the automobile over everything else. Today it is again a cultural hub, that freeway replaced with a plaza where locals try to convince the tourists to buy this or that trinket, the homeless laze out in the open, and skateboarders attempt impressive jumps. The building itself was restored in 2003 with a teeming marketplace on the first floor, office space on the upper floors, and an active ferry service. The Saturday farmers market was still going on when we arrived, so we started on the right and grazed our way left; a plumeto, latkes with hummus, bread dipped in olive oil samples, blackberry pie, and a half a roasted chicken we picked apart with our hands, served as lunch. The variety of stuff from fresh produce, to ready to eat bites, to artisan cart iron pans, pottery, and blown glass, made walking about good fun.
        <br><br>
            On Sunday we tried surfing out in the Pacific. The size of the surf was below average everywhere so we headed to Ocean Beach, a spot where they sometimes host professional events, because today it had good 3ft starter waves. Parking our car in outer Sunset, a neighborhood perpetually cloaked in fog, we rented boards and wetsuits from a local surf shop. I stretched and contorted my body trying to get my rented, already wet, wet suit on in the stores one changing room. I succeeded, walked out, and was told that I had put it on inside out. Back to the back of the line I went. The experience taught me that the only thing harder than getting in an already wet, wet suit, is getting it back off.
        <br><br>
            Properly clothed and struggling to carry our massive boards, we stepped into the frigid Pacific. It was so cold that when a wave hit all air would immediately gust out of you. Sabina, a beginner surfer but not a novice like Isabel or I, took the lead and tried to show us how to paddle out, how to crest oncoming waves, and in theory how to catch a wave. I’m not sure how they measure waves, but these three footers looked at least eight feet tall. Sitting atop our boards they would rise up well above our heads, crash atop us, and pummel us back to shore. At first it was exhilarating just catching these waves while lying down on our boards. Crashing just behind us, the power of the wave would shoot us on a 100ft long slide. After a few runs of that we became more ambitious, trying to get father out so we could potentially ride some of the bigger ones. After battling out a couple hundred feet, I couldn’t quite hear Sabinas explanation but she seemed to be saying to wait for the second wave of a pair because it was bigger. Freezing, battered, and drunk on sea water, none of us could quite get up on a big one. We’d get battered trying to get out there, finally get ourselves in position, miss the angle slightly, and get flipped all around in the eventual crash. It was exhausting but also exhilarating. The cold made you feel every inch of your aliveness, and the constancy of the waves demanded your attention and determination. We kept with it for what felt like a while, but slowly our ranks began falling. Isabel hyperextended her hand while blocking the board from slamming into her head in the wake of a wave and was done. Sabina fell back shortly thereafter realizing success for us was not in the cards. Stubbornly I kept at it for one last full push all the way out there. The waves were now looking much larger than when we had started. Punished again by the second wave of a large pair, no final glory was achieved. I turned around and rode back to shore on one of those smaller waves we had once been so exhilarated by.
        <br><br>
            An amazing experience, small and insignificant we stood there pummeled by an uncaring tide, launching ourselves back out into the breakers because we thought it was fun. Absolutely freezing though, this had none of the sun and tan one imagines with surfing, and a hot shower has never felt so heavenly and impossible to get out of.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Monday could have made the whole trip worth it by itself. Off we went into Napa County for a day of rock climbing and wine. On our way we picked up Sabina’s climbing buddy Cooper, a slightly disheveled rustically handsome man who lived on a boat in Alameda Harbor, and got gear at REI for me and Isabel. Up north we headed, passing vineyard after vineyard, through the small towns of Napa Valley to _____ State Park. From the trailhead we headed .5 miles _____. Poking out from a distant ridge, it looked like an upside down cup, so itsy small. I was imagining a large sheer face. If that could be used for serious rock climbing, potential spots are everywhere! I thought. But then as we approached the cloak of perspective was removed, leaving a 60ft boulder of volcanic rock. We climbed down off trail to the far side of the boulder where all the climbing routes were and set up shop.
        <br><br>
            Isabel had basically never climbed, I had only climbed a half dozen or so times inside, Sabina was an avid intermediate, and Cooper our grizzled veteran. Cooper would go up first and lead climb, stringing the rope through carabiners he had brought up with him and attached to bolts fastened to the rock by our forefathers. Cooper was tasked with this job because it involves climbing the route, stopping along the way, one hand on the wall one hand fiddling with the gear, and then properly looping the rope through. Once at the top Coop would tie off and repel down the route set up for the rest of us to attempt.
        <br><br>
            Up through the bottom loop and out through the top loo of the harness, make a figure eight knot, count the two’s, make sure there are five of them, “belay?”, “belay ready”, “climbing”, “climb on”, up we went. The dark grey rock had the texture of molten tortilla chips, very sharp and jagged. Not pointy enough to cut our hands, they made for fantastic holds and Isabel and I were able to make it up the first couple of routes cleanly. It was incredible climbing outside. Compared to climbing indoors was the difference between a cold and a hot shower. It almost felt like a wholly different experience. Climbing actual rock made it feel like a basic human skill, no longer a fabricated sport humans invented to distract themselves. Add in the sun, wind, beautiful views, music, friends, and red wine to sip on between climbs, what could be better.
        <br><br>
            Having warmed up now we moved left on the boulder to try and tackle some of the more difficult routes. The rock bulges out here making the first part of the climb overhung and thus far more difficult. Isabel and I drank and watched as Coop and Sabina slipped off the rock 15 feet up a few times. It looked extremely challenging trying to get over the hinge of the bulge. When they had completed the route and told us we were up, we had little faith it was going to happen for us. A series of small overhung holds up ten feet before you had to swing left for a water bottle shaped rock with your left hand and then somehow navigate your way around a small shipping box sized rock sticking out in the middle of the route right at the edge of the bulge. After that the route flattened out and it would be pretty easy to scurry up the last 25 feet. Try one, and I didn’t even get to the third hold. Try two, I slipped off the water bottle sized jug with ease. Try eight, I slipped off the water bottle sized jug with ease. Try ten, I went with a slightly different route and made it up to the shipping box and slipped off. I just hung there 12 feet off the ground, exhausted, my hands truly aching, my harness giving me quite the weggie. A couple feeble attempts later I asked to be brought down so I could take a rest. I knew the route now, I could fly through the holds out right, and understood that I needed to quickly move off the water bottle to have the momentum to get a good hold at the top of the shipping box. At 5.11 this route was way beyond my previous accomplishments indoors. But sheere persistence won the day. I was able to execute the plan perfectly, right hand getting a nice hold on the edge of the shipping box, enough to pull myself up and wrap my left hand on the other side, and skin myself up over the ledge of the box. Isabel, the legend she is, also accomplished the route. 5’ 3” and a ball of energy she may have found her calling on the wall. She loved the experience and looked to be an absolute natural.
        <br><br>
            4pm, the sun starting to color our surroundings yellow, we packed up our gear, sipped the last of our wine, and merrily made our way into the valley for a late wine tasting.
        <br><br>
            “Y’all wanna go through the prescribed wine tasting or just pour you guys some good shit?”
        <br><br>
            Clearly Alli could tell by our appearance and merriness that we weren't her average Napa Valley customers. Four ragtag looking kids, arriving 45 minutes before closing, she knew she could shoot the shit with us.
        <br><br>
            “It’s been a baaad day. I real bad day. Get this, this literally happened today. My whole life I’ve been told my great grandfather was a pitcher for the Yankees.” Pointing to the well-worn yankees cap on her head. “This morning I call up my grandma and ask her for details; when he played, how good, how long. You know what she said?! ‘Oh no Frank was a pitcher on the Red Sox’ My whole life I’ve been a Yankees fan and now the fucking Red Sox! Why not the Indians or some shit? So it’s been a bad day. I gotta go and buy a new hat now.”
        <br><br>
            She had us in stitches with basically anything she said. She had a large, voluminous, woman from Brooklyn vibe, with a “I’m walking here!” voice, and the ability to banter with anyone.
        <br><br>
            “You look like the mother of the group.” She said to Iz after a few pours. “Like all up tight and professional.” Not at all true but had the three of us almost falling off our chairs in laughter.
        <br><br>
            We shut the place down, sadly parted with our newfound friend, and headed to get burgers and shakes at the iconic Gott’s Roadside. A burger joint on the main road through Napa, it has a pristine 1960’s look; outdoor seating, neon lights, a white and red paint job, and those funky angled overhangs which just scream drive through. We went all in ravenous, each of us having only eaten a breakfast sandwich that morning. Shakes, fries, funky burgers, and a bottle of Zinfandel, our new favorite wine. The four of us just worked as a group, the dynamic just so fun. We just kept ordering, seconds, thirds, trying to extend this great day as long as we could.
        <br><br>
            “Ohhh shit. I thought my flight was at 10pm, it's actually at 7:15,” Isabel blurted.  Our great day suddenly over, we scrambled to get out stuff in the trash and our bodies in the car. We had a good laugh about her being the adult in the room. But we had to roll! 5:30 we had 1:12 to SFO. No time to stop and pick up Iz’s stuff at Sabina’s. No time to drop Cooper and me off in East Bay which we would be driving through. All Isabel had was what she was wearing, her phone, walley, keys, and dirty clothes from climbing. Fortunately Sabina and Iz would see each other the following weekend for a Haverford reunion. But it meant Iz would be flying back in only her flowy sundress. Sweaty from climbing she’d decided to go commando for wine and burgers. There was no changing now. The next day she wired us to say she’d arrived but had woken up a couple of times during the flight to see one of her boobs just hanging out.

            Try driving a long nail into rock. It's impossible. The nail will bend in half between the force of the hammer and the unmoving rock. That is exactly what it felt like trying to get these tent spikes into Acorn’s backyard. It had not rained in months and the ground was impenetrable.
        <br><br>
            After a couple of meals with bay area friends, some more neighborhood exploring, and a week of work, here I was Friday night trying to set up my mother’s 1980’s tent on six month dry terrain. The design was classic, an extruded triangle, looking like the tent emoji. Three metal bars created an upside down U shape, which was the backbone of the tent. This was held in place, and thus the tent livable, by six stakes pulling the floor of the tent out as far as is could stretch. The problem was that the stakes were close to impossible to get in, and once they were in the ground, it had the consistency of marbles with large crumbly bits, so the tent would sway slightly in the cool bay area evening, the stakes would pull out, and the tent would collapse.
        <br><br>
            I was doing this as a trial run for my weekend in Yosemite. I had slept outside in Denver but we’d used Madison’s tent, and with Noah we’d been doing so much driving at night that we opted for the $42 Ramada or $46 Motel 8 over trying to set up a tent in the windiest part of the country in the thirty five degree night. Other than that I had been staying with friends, so this was my maiden voyage with the tent. My mom had used it 40 years before when she lived out in San Francisco and camped in Yosemite. Since it had been sitting in the closet of our NYC apartment. We had pretended to set it up before I’d left just to make sure all the pieces were still present, but it's not like we drove stakes into the apartment’s hardwood floors. Here I was just trying to make sure it would stand the night before having to rely on it out in the woods. Accomplishing that turned into a Sisyphean task.
        <br><br>
            I moved to a couple different places in the grass before finally finding my finagling, praying, and scolding, paid off. Two hours and 7 bent or broken stakes later I had a standing tent. With Tara, Acorn’s girlfriend spending the night, I decided to sleep in my newly constructed masterpiece over sleeping on the couch. Cozy with my sleeping bag and sleeping pad I was amazed to wake up at 7am the following morning with the tent canvas still above me. Test passed.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-break">~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Sprawled flat on my stomach I was inching myself towards the ledge. I was absolutely petrified, not trusting my body to stand. Finally I made it to peer over and look 1,000 feet straight down to the valley floor. Absolutely breathtaking. Across from me the great wall of El Capitan rose, the morning sun illuminating all of its subtle color. A waterfall, one of the few still flowing this time of year, was arcing over the edge to my left. I was looking at what John Muir called “by far the grandest of all the special temples of Nature I was ever permitted to enter.”
        <br><br>
            Saturday morning I had risen early, packed up the tent from Acorn’s backyard and headed three hours west. On the route I passed through very hilly wheat colored grassland, then groves of peach trees their leaves orange and red, and finally to wooded mountain slopes. I arrived at the first come campsite around noon, filled out an orange slip with my $18 dollars, and headed to campsite 31. It came equipped with a bear box for all food, a wooden tent, a firepit, and a patch of dirt on which to set up your tent. The stakes went into the packed dirt like going into buttah! And held tight! The tent was up in ten minutes, food was stowed in the bear box, and I was off for a small afternoon hike.
        <br><br>
            Asleep just after sunset at 5:45 Saturday evening, I was up and at ‘em Sunday morning at daybreak. And yet still by the time I got to Yosemite Valley the place was a zoo. A visitor center, an art gallery, multiple campgrounds, a medical clinic, a grocery store, a chapel, and many other buildings littered the valley, looking quite unnatural in perhaps the most beautiful place in America. Then there were the cars, so many cars, and the buses which you needed to take from central parking to any of the trailheads in the valley. The valley still had moments of awe, like seeing the small cocoon tents dangling halfway up El Capitan indicating a climber had spent the night 500ft up in the air, or when half down came peering over the conifers with Yosemite ricer trickling in the bottom third of the frame. Yet there was something off about the place. As if the amusement park atmosphere of its pre National Park days still had vestiges, with the buildings staying the same, just under the new management of the NPS rather than private purveyors.
        <br><br>
            For that reason I headed up to a trail atop the valleys walls to peer at its magnificence away from the hullabaloo. At least that's what I was thinking. Unfortunately Yosemite is so popular that everywhere had people. Trailhead parking was full so I had to park in the ditch a quarter mile up the road. 7.4 miles, the trail cut down to Taft Point from which I peered down to the incredible view of the valley foor, across to Glacier Point for a panoramic vista of half dome and the grey slopes of clouds rest beyond, before doubling back and finishing at Sentinel Dome for sunset on the highest point in the valley. It was a tour de force of the iconic views the park is famous for.
        <br><br>
            I have been team Yellowston since reading American Wolf, rooting for it to be the crown jewel of the National Park system, but after seeing half dome with clouds rest behind and Nevada Falls off to its right, I could understand why Yosemite held the top spot in many people's hearts. It is the greatest natural amusement park in the world. It may not have the wildlife of the Everglades or Yellowstone, the scientific importance of Carlsbad or Haleakalā, or the remote wilderness of Glacier, but it had some of the best hiking and climbing in the world, waterfalls that looked as if they were computer generated, and cliff faces made for iconic photographs. It is nature designed for human consumption, and what an enjoyable feast it is.

            When was I actually going to turn 25? Was it based on the local time of my departure location? My arrival location? The local time of the place underneath the plane as we crossed the country? Or instead should it be based on the timezone I was actually born in, translated to the timezone of the place underneath the plane as we crossed the country? Fortunately, all of these questions were academic. Born in New York at 3:10pm on Nov 21 1994, I would be back in my original time zone when the clock hit 3:10pm 25 years later; my planes expected arrival time was 7:05am on the 21st. The important thing was that I would be with Izzer and the Lads for my quarter century mark. During trip planning I had imagined this day and figured it would be a bit lonely to be secluded on the West Coast. Why not come back a bit early, celebrate with friends, and then have a nice relaxing thanksgiving with the family.

            The thanksgiving break was long, and felt too long. My father wanted to have a joint birthday party Saturday night after thanksgiving, and with the prices of flights back it meant flying back the Wednesday afterwards. Spending my birthday with my friends, Thanksgiving with the friends, the joint birthday, and all the days in-between were very enjoyable. But the days afterwards were just sooo slooow. I yearned for the pace of the trip, my mind still churning at that pace. The break felt like sitting down after a hard run. Wheezing, your muscles aching, what feels best is a walk or even a slow jog. An immediate stop and you feel too small for your body, your heart pounding, all the gases and fluids pushing up against their boundaries.
      <br><br>
            Sitting middle seat next to the bathroom with a seat that could not recline on my flight back across, I was excited for all the driving coming up in the next ten days. I would arrive Wednesday night, work from Acorn’s Thursday, drive to LA thursday night, stay with my friend Benny Ruskin for the weekend, and spend the following week driving across the southwest to Austin. I was going to be a road warrior. The first steps of this plan went as expected. I arrived around 9pm at SFO, spent 2.5 hours on the BART to get to Acorn’s ( The Bay Area’s public transit is a joke ), worked from Acorn's Thursday, and sped through the night down I-5 to Los Angeles.

            Benny Ruskin, a friend from college had just moved out to attend UCLA Law and was gearing up for his first semester’s finals. He’d told me he’d be studying months before so I totally knew what to expect. The first night I was there though we went out to The Groundlings, a local breeding ground for SNL talent. Sketch comedy done to the highest level Benny, his girlfriend Melinda, and I had full belly laughs on very empty bellies. The Pizza we’d ordered had shown up 1:15 hours late, 15 minutes after we had left, so we asked for a refund and were left with a granola bar and plantain chips we purchased at the corner store for dinner. Combined with our lateness from trying to wait for the pizza we only got a couple of chips down before entering the theatre.

            The best two sketches were, one, an effeminate male cruise ship choreographer trying to teach his staff how to perform Frozen, and two, a young girl who was disappointed with the nice presents she had received for Christmas, because MONEY was all she wanted, just like Cardi B had told her. Between sets though the three of us were scheming, planning, dreaming, fantasizing about what we were going to eat afterwards. We decided on The Apple Pan, the “Best Burger Joint in LA”. A shack from the 1940’s with a large U shaped counter providing seating for 26. We devoured the burgers too fast for our taste buds to pick up any flavor, but Oh My the banana cream pie!!! Heavenly. I have been dreaming about it nightly since. Dense whipped cream, a thick layer of banana creme, three inches of sliced bananas at their perfect ripeness, and a chewy crust below. I was doubting the order at first, but it may have been the best desert I’ve ever had. The banana flavor was strong and not too sweet either. It meant you could down a whole slice and it almost felt healthy. I’d never seen banana in a pie before but I am absolutely ordering it the next time I do.

            Our tour guide, Randi, was pointing at a basketball court long by basketball court wide parking lot that was painted a light blue and sunken a few feet down. “They shot the parting of the Red Sea here for the movie 10 Commandments. How do you think they did it?”
      <br><br>
            “They filmed it in reverse!” A blond woman in the back piped up.
      <br><br>
            “Exactly. They had barriers which they pulled back to let the water rush in and then they played it in reverse.”
      <br><br>
            I was on the Paramount Studios tour, the oldest production house in LA, and movie magic was everywhere. On a property a few city blocks square, movies such as Rear Window, Airplane!, Forrest Gump, and many more were written, cast, shot, and edited. Everywhere you looked had been used at one time or another for a shot. There was a back alley where many of the getaway scenes for NCIS were filmed. The writers building doubled as an embassy for Mission Impossible. A movie theatre was converted into a hotel lobby. It was amazing looking at this banal scenery and seeing how by adding a couple of details and shooting from a specific angle it believably showed up on the big screen as something else.
      <br><br>
            “Hitchkock was one of the bigtime directors we had here at Paramount, but he was chronically going over budget and breaking rules so they moved his office there, right next to the executive offices. It did not work, he put a bookcase up against the windows so nobody could see in. One time he wanted four story buildings inside studio 16, which would have meant building a taller building. The request was declined, so in the middle of the night he locked the doors and dug down 15 feet to get the desired angle for the shot.”
      <br><br>
            “We are now passing the Foley Department. They are responsible for creating the sounds you hear during movies. Coconut shells for horse hooves, snapping celery for breaking bones, lasering grapes for dying aliens.” WHATTTT lasering grapes for aliens?! Such a cool department. Those folks must walk with perked ears, always on the lookout for a more believable replica sound.
      <br><br>
            The final stop on the tour was the set of Grace and Frankie. I watched an episode of the show later that day and it was unbelievable how they make it feel like a luxurious beach house. The set doesn’t even have running water! They use a hose to pump water for the sink and have a bucket underneath to catch the runoff. Forget about the second floor, it doesn't exist. It is a stairway to nowhere. The ceiling isn't real, it flaps up to allow for more lighting during daylight scenes and flapped down when the ceiling would be in the shot. It gave me a new appreciation for actors. The setting was so fake, it seemed impossible to have real emotion. Yet somehow they had to show feelings while ignoring the fans on the far side of the plywood walls trying to simulate a sea breeze.

            The Los Angeles Acropolis; built high up in the hills where you can see both the Pacific ocean and the Angeles mountains stood the Getty Center, a modern take on a retirement home for art. After all museums do rather little to support current artists, they are better described as Art Hall of Fames. These hall of famers were from Paul Getty’s personal collection. Protagonist in the movie All the Money in the World, his money had purchased the land, commissioned Richard Meier as architect, and endowed the museum with $1.2 billion. Having now grown to $6.2 billion the Getty is the best endowed museum in the world. The result is a world class museum that is free to the public.
      <br><br>
            From the parking lot you are taken by tram up through the manicured gardens to the public square. Vast and tiled with travertine, it was apparent immediately that the place was playing against classical architecture. The building was not symmetrical, there were columns that were square instead of round, the fountains had interesting looking stones in the place of statues. As I used to work for an architectural firm and still love it, I immediately walked up the front steps and hopped on an architecture tour that was just starting. “The buildings were built atop two ridgelines that met at a 22.5 degree angle and they oriented the campus as details aligned with one ridgeline or the other.” “The travertine stones were mined at Bagni di Tivoli in Italy and there are 27 especially beautiful stones which have been hidden away as treats for the especially adventurous.” “Richard Meier always makes white buildings, but the wealthy neighbors of Bel Air and Brentwood made him tone it down to this limestone shade.” “The curves of the building on the right side are meant to mimic the ocean waves which are visible off in the distance on the right.” “All the stones are 30”x30” or some common fraction like ½, or ¼.”
      <br><br>
            Tour over I walked through the welcoming rotunda and out into the center courtyard. It was rather odd looking, the buildings around had all these funky shapes. There was no clear entrance or place to start. It was like a true American public square where all the buildings were built during different eras and to different tastes and thus you are left with a hodgepodge of matter that doesn't look all that good together. Except here all the buildings were built with those 30x30 travertine tiles which gave the space its continuity. It meant the space felt textured like there were tons of areas to explore, rather than a haphazard collection of misfits. Upon further exploration this turned out to be exactly true. There were small fountains hidden behind buildings, a cacti garden with a view of LA in the back, sight lines which were atop ridgelines that went through buildings all the way across campus, and my personal favorite, windows through the travertine to the outside world. Once inside one of the four main buildings, order was restored. Sculpture and other physical arts were on the first floor, paintings on the second. And if you started with the building on the left the buildings housed art in chronological order, starting with Medieval Art and finishing with 20th century photography. I didn’t have all that much time to explore the exhibits, but the ones I saw, impressionism and 20th century photography, were excellent. I had mostly come for the architecture and because Isabel, a museum lover, said it was her favorite museum in the world.
      <br><br>
            My criteria for good architecture is ‘does it improve on nature?’. Would I rather see this or the land in its natural form? Most things don’t make the cut. Many old neighborhoods do; I would much prefer walking around Back Bay in Boston that the marshy bog it replaced. I am not sure the Getty as a whole makes the cut. It is interesting, but is it better than the last untouched ridgeline in the LA hills? It feels like a concept car, designed to provoke thought, but not necessarily to be attractive or useful yet. There were moments of brilliance though. The framed shots around the campus compliment nature beautifully. Meier accomplished these by making cutouts in the travertine to reveal a particularly beautiful scene behind. In his most extreme example he built an unnecessary addition to the top edge of a building so that the view of the sky through it would be framed. It was a novel idea to me and the frame made whatever was inside better looking. It focused your eye on the specific rather than a whole landscape which is hard to take in. Each framed shot of nature was like a little piece of art against which the art inside the buildings should be compared. “Does this framed piece of art improve on this framed piece of nature?”

            The next day I went on a long walk around some of those famous LA neighborhoods I’d only ever heard of: Hollywood, Venice, Santa Monica, Melrose. My conclusion, it is funny to call LA a city. San Francisco is a bit the same way. They are distributed systems. Each neighborhood has its own commercial area, usually a line of shops a half mile long, that is wholly disconnected from any other commercial area. Each neighborhood is a self contained organism and a form of transportation like a bus, scooter, or most often a car, is needed to get from one fiefdom to another.
      <br><br>
            Both cities were a bit difficult to understand, so diffuse in their energy. No beating heart like the old east coast cities. Their energy was like the open circulatory system of arthropods, free to flow this way and that. Easily you could have visited and felt like you hadn’t seen THE CITY; you’d missed it somehow. In some ways it was nice. It meant the claustrophobia of a place like Time Square was absent. Hollywood in comparison felt quite manageable and tame. One could stop and pause by their favorite star and people had plenty of space to go around on either side of you; the buildings rose maybe 10 stories, the lights neon, but not overwhelming, almost tasteful. They were all wonderful little neighborhoods, each potentially charming, but it felt wrong to call a collection of them a city. They were suburbia at its finest.

            If there is one thing to have in the Desert it is water, and I didnt have it. Not a drop. I had meant to fill up on my way into the park, but a call from my parents right at the entrance got me distracted. Now I was 15 minutes down the road and water was at the entrance. Turning back to fill up would cost me all of my good planning. Fitting outdoor tourism into a workday when the sun was setting at 4:46 was not easy. I’d packed up on Sunday, got online early, worked hard, and left Benny’s at 1. That meant I could get to the trailhead at Joshua Tree National Park by 3:45. My plan was to exit through the south entrance, a 1:15 hour drive away, so I wasn’t going to have another chance to fill up on water until 8 or so that night. A responsible 25 year old now I u-turned and cost myself almost half of my daylight.
      <br><br>
            I got to the trailhead at 4:15 and started sprinting. 1.5 miles, 1,000 ft elevation gain, and 30 minutes of daylight to go. Everyone else on the trail was coming down, me the loner, darting around them up the trail. The views were fantastic, expansive and golden in the fading light. Joshua Trees, a prickly 15 foot tall desert tree dotted the valley, with shrubs and short cacti covering the mountain slopes. I did not marvel for long though, only stopping for a few seconds here or there to catch my breath. “Turn around, you’re crazy!! It's soo cold up there!” Urged two shivering boys about two thirds of the way up. And it was true, the winds had turned icy, warning of how quickly the temperature would change out here in the desert. Fortunately my pace kept me huffing and puffing, and warm. I made it to the top in shorts. I just missed sundown though, the golden glow still very visible along the ridgeline of the distant mountains.
      <br><br>
            It felt a bit funny to be rushing to cram everything in. Was it fun trying to pack so much in. I’d rushed all day for a breathless and wheezing 30 minutes on Ryan Mountain. A bit odd and not ideal, but better than the alternative, right? It would be kinda depressing just working and driving all week, none of these small adventures interspersed.
      <br><br>
            I put on sweatpants, buttoned up my sweatshirt, and headed down. The air was cold and the sky deepening shades of purple. Down by 5:30, I hopped in the car and got moving. I stopped an hour later, after all the fading light had been extinguished, near the edge of the park to stargaze. There was very little artificial light, shown by the horizon not having a light glow, but the moon was nearly full. Such a bright glow emanated that hiking at night seemed totally doable the jumping chollas and other prickly friends clearly vizable. Unfortunately it meant that the milky-way was not visible. Known for its phenomenal star gazing, tonight Joshua Tree was merely okay.

            Trump may have his hands full with Mr. Shifty Schiff, but today I had to deal with the far more meddlesome shifty schist. Originally granite which has undergone a very dubious metamorphasos, away from government oversight, down beneath the earth's crust, Schist is a striaghated rock, seperated into sheets of colored minerals. It has a tendency to break along those mineral fault lines. Shifty I tell you! It lies in wait for some unsuspecting park visitor like myself, just trying to appreciate the 250 year Saguaros in Saguaro National Park. A foothold breaks away, as I try to climb up a 40 foot boulder, tumbling down an unseeable distance. Not trustworthy at all! I rescue myself through a quick hold with my right hand, but that too starts cracking down the seam. I trust the rock no longer, darting as fast as lightning up the pitch. Nobody has ever done it faster. “Be gone shifty schist, no more today!” I decared up on the summit. 40 feet up I could look ahead and see saguaros all up the Rincon Mountains or behind and see the sun falling over Tucson. I could take in Saguaro National Park, knowing I’d completed the most magnificent, death defying, unbelievable climb in US history.

            Unfortunately I had to do much of the driving from California to Texas at night, breaking my road trip rule. There was just not enough daylight. Less than two weeks until the winter solstice, it was getting dark a little after 5pm. Working 7-3, I could either use the daylight to drive and see the landscape or tour a national park. I opted for the latter, often leaving the parks with the stars visible above. That left 6pm-Midnight to churn out the miles. It was a very disheartening drive from Saguaro NP to El Paso. The full moon illuminated the surrounding rock formations enough to tell me I was missing something special, but other than that, New Mexico was veiled by darkness.
      <br><br>
            Even more unfortunate than the drive was arriving in El Paso at 11pm on a Wednesday. I took the exit for downtown, hoping to get a quick feel for the city and a bit to eat. What met me looked like a hollywood set not currently in use. El Paso St. was lined with one story wild west looking storefronts, every single one shuttered, not a single car or pedestrian visible anywhere. It was honestly erie waiting at a stoplight alone; sitting there for a minute as the perpendicular green and the pedestrian walk signs went unused, not a single other car waiting with me. It felt silly. Who was I waiting for? And god dammit why did I hit four red lights in a six block stretch! Other parts of the city were more architecturally impressive, but I did not enjoy the private tour I received of what is supposed to be a cool city.

            As a general rule, the older the national park, the more it blew me away. I hadn’t really thought about that during my trip planning, but maybe I should have. At a time when conservation was not yet part of the American lexicon, those first national parks were so overwhelmingly spectacular that a majority of people realized we needed to preserve them. Then after we realized how terrific an idea the National Parks were, the places we wanted to protect grew. All of this to say, I should have had higher expectations for Carlsbad Caverns NP formed in 1930. It was nearby the route from El Paso to Austin so I figured it and its neighbor Guatalupe NP were worth a visit.
      <br><br>
            It's funny to think about how much of the trip revolved around the national parks. Yellowstone had been a big inspiration for the trip, but I had not planned for the itinerary to be so National Parks focused. I guess as a city kid who’d basically always lived in either New York or Boston, the cities of the west did not have that much appeal. Built in the automobile era, the population centers of the west are sprawling, ugly, and charmless. I really liked the small old towns along the way like Idaho Springs Colorado, Lancing Wyoming, and Fredericksburg Texas. They held charm and I liked imagining what my life would look like there. But in comparison to the East, with its history and quaint brownstone lines streets, the West’s virtue was in its varied and spectacular nature. So many different climates and ecosystems existed in relatively close proximity that going from one park to another was like transporting yourself to a different planet. Different plants and animals lived by different rules, dictated by the extremely different climates. January is the time of snow and hibernation in Yellowstone, meanwhile in Saguaro it is 70 degrees and the lush rainy season. I guess what I am trying to say is that the beating heart of the west lies in the in-between. Plus meals and shows are not as much fun when riding solo. Nature's splendores on the other hand were not lessened because I was alone, in a way they were heightened.
      <br><br>
            I took a vacation day because the last entrance ticket was 3:15 and the Caverns were at least two hours east of El Paso, so no way fit in a workday working in central time. Plus I had a vacation day to spare. With the whole day off I took a detour to take a look at the much talked about border wall and the border crossing into Juarez. There was not much to see, just a 14ft fence going into the distance in both directions and a line of traffic coming over the bridge from Juarez. However uninteresting the border was I still managed to get a late start to the parks. It meant that I just drove by Guadalupe NP on my way to Carlsbad. The road, route 62, went right through Guadalupe mountains though and offered fantastic views of them so I felt like I saw the highlights. Plus I did not have the inclination for yet another hike so I was happy to keep moving.
      <br><br>
            Arriving at Carlsbad Caverns I bought my ticket, got some christmas gifts at the very expansive gift shop, and headed down into the depths. A gaping mouth with a narrow winding walkway down into the darkness was the welcoming mat. The temperature dropped to 57 degrees, and the natural light was extinguished almost immediately, to be replaced by the dim, dank, dripping passageways leading deeper down. Jim White the park’s first chief ranger, described the entrance on his first sight of the cave at age 15, “I found myself gazing into the biggest and blackest hole I had ever seen, out of which the bats seemed literally to boil.'' On his first expeditions into the cave he used a ladder handmade from nearby shrubs and a handheld lantern. Those bats plus any number of creatures his imagination could conjure up lurked behind the blackness he described as ‘solid’. Across dangerous ledges, around holes which seemed to go down forever, and up and over wet and slippery rocks, god knows what compelled him to venture hundreds of feet down into the blackness. But thank goodness he did, as his explorations were chiefly responsible for bringing attention to the Caverns and our government's recognition of their significance. Today a visit is far more comfortable. Some blasting has occurred to allow for a steep but walkable path, and lights were installed along the path to illuminate particularly beautiful elements of the passageway. Plus elevator shafts have been installed to allow for an easy exit route rather than walking the 1.25 miles back uphill.
      <br><br>
            1000 feet down the walkway flattened out and led into the Big Room. 8.2 acres in size with 70ft tall ceilings it was extensively decorated with stalactites, stalagmites, draperies, cave pearls, lily pads, soda straws, and countless other formations. The audio tour explained that stalactites were those that held tight to the ceiling, stalagmites stood up mightily from the floor, draperies formed against slanted walls and looked like 18th century curtains, lily pads formed at the top of ponds, and on and on with other descriptions. I was in absolute awe. It looked like the treasure room found at the end of National Treasure, except that everything was made of rock. Starting 15-20 million years ago rising tectonic plates drained the water table, sulfuric acid formed and slowly converted the limestone into gypsum which fell off and dissolved in the remaining pools of water. This created the caverns themselves. Then as rainwater dripped down hundreds of feet into the cave it picked up minerals, mostly calcite which it deposited to form the formations present today. All the rock a pale white color and each room looking suspiciously like the last, those first explorers were liberal in their naming of unique formations to help orient themselves. The totem pole, the rock of ages, the bottomless pit, were some of their most memorable. We were encouraged to keep up the tradition as we walked around. I came up with ‘Pin Prick Overhang’ for a half dome with 6 foot long super pencil thick stalactites. ‘Vertical Forests’ for a group of tall pillars where the sides looked like rings of trees stacked on top of one another. Water would drip onto the top branches creating a dome, then drain down a few paths, creating the branches and trunk, before dropping onto the canopy of the tree below. These pillars had six or seven layers of trees, each level a couple of feet tall. ‘Grand Chandelier’ for a mass of stalactites at the top of a large vaulted ceiling. ‘The NYC Rat’ for a set of fallen boulders which looked like a 15ft tall rat standing on its hind legs. The fun of naming the different formations, combined with the foreign beauty of the place, made Carlsbad my favorite park of the trip. I'm a big cave guy now! Next step is to go on one of the guided cave tours where they turn off all the lights, giving the visitor a rare opportunity to experience total darkness.

            JB Gallegos, what a guy!! Owner of Comanch Tortilla & Tamale Factory, he served up a delightful lunch in Fort Stockton Texas. An oil outpost in the Permian Basin, JB had grown up there, moved to SF for school, to New York to attend Julliard, and was now back in Fort Stockton, retired and with big plans. A newly constructed theatre across the street was his doing. He and his male partner, in deep red Texas, had purchased 5 or 6 other buildings in town and had plans for a B&b, an asain fusion restaurant, and an art gallery. In this wind swept, sun baked, brown colored place, JB had himself busy! I met him behind the counter at his family's 71 year old tortilla and tamale establishment, 6ft tall, white hair poking out the sides of his baseball cap, burly, and overwhelmingly friendly. Large sinks carved from a single piece of stone, aloe plants the size of small children, and eclectic art gave the place ambiance. Cheese & Jalapeno and pork tamales gave you a reason to return day after day. Boy were they good. He invited me to sit as I ate and talked my ear off. 45 minutes later I was sad when I had to leave and get back to work, I had a code release to get out.

            Going out with Ryan was fun. Raised in Austin, he started working in restaurants as a teen, and at this point had worked at the foodiest places in a foodie town. At various times he was a server, a line chef, and a sous chef, so he knew everyone. The hostess would recognize him, he would go over and say hi to his friends in the kitchen, the owner would come over at some point and ask Ryan what he was up to these days, maybe a little amuse bouche would be sent out complimentary of the kitchen, and one time our entire lunch was just taken care of by an old boss of his. Feeling like an honored guest was only part of the fun though. The food industry attracts people in all stages of life with a whole range of interests, so the people we were hanging out with all had different ambitions and personalities that made them all very interesting to talk to. In addition, they all had such descriptive vocabulary when it came to food that they were able to put into words all the feels which I was only subtly aware of tasting. “The cumquat gives such a nice floral and acidic element to the taco.” “The grill gives it that beautiful smokey note even though they are sous viding it.” Even if I was completely stuffed, if Ryan suggested another place, I said yes, just because I felt like I was learning so much about food and having such a good time in the process.

            Food ate up much of our free time, but we managed to squeeze in a tour of the capital, a dip in Barton Springs, and a walk through the trail of lights. The capitol building looked to be a replica of the US capital except that in Texan fashion, it had to be bigger, 14ft taller to be exact. With the Texas congress in session only every other year, and this being an off year, the place was totally quiet; all the better for us visitors, as they gave us the run of the place, touring both the house and senate chambers as well as the new extension; all the fun parts which had been off limits when I did a tour of the US capitol building.
      <br><br>
            Barton Springs was the most charming public works project I’ve ever seen. A natural spring turned swimming hole, it is reason enough to move to Austin. 200ft long, and 20ft wide, it has a natural rock bottom that provides a range of depths from inches deep on one side to 15ft deep on the other. On the day I visited it was in the low 70s, and there were a couple dozen folks doing laps. The water was a constant 68 degrees year round, and I stayed lapping up the sunlight for a delightfully long time.
      <br><br>
            On our last night we took a trip back to our younger days and enjoyed an Austin christmas tradition, the Trail of Lights: A park transformed with christmas lights, fun houses, and nativity scenes. Perfect family fun, which Ryan and his brothers hadn’t been to since they were 12 and we all had good fun turning back the clock and giving into the Christmas spirit. We got crepes and grilled cheese, tacos and hot cocoa, at various stands along the way. We poked our heads into the candy factory and ogled at a map of the world made of christmas lights. So extensive was the lighting of the trees that we joked that the whole event was a subsidy to the town’s crane companies.

            The end of the trip felt near at this point, only ten days remaining, which cast me into a melancholy mood. The unspectacularity of Houston did not help matters. It is the definition of a working city and the antithesis of a vacation destination (when the rodeo is not in session). Driving around and parking is easy, housing costs are low, jobs are plentiful, but the tourist attractions for the week consisted of a visit to the art museum and a round at the new municipal golf course. Those two were so spectacular though, combined with hanging with my sis, that they completely transformed by mood.
      <br><br>
            At the Museum of Fine Arts Houston they had an exhibit on Normal Rockwell, famous for his paintings detailing american life and the covers he made for the Saturday Evening Post. The exhibit was incredibly extensive, taking up five large rooms with well over 100 of his paintings and sketches. The exhibit’s focus was on Rockwell’s four freedoms series, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear, the basic human rights outlined by FDR in his 1941 State of the Union speech. This meant the majority of the works revolved around the production of those works, and complementary pieces that he did surrounding World War II. Although considered by critics to be middle brow art, they were absolutely charming to us. Always relevant to the current events they are delightful commentaries on American Society. Almost like political cartoons mixed with expert paint stroked. No need to read the little plaque to understand the piece, the message was self evident. Moving from room to room was like moving from era to era, you could see how the political consciousness changed focus over his career. From sports and everyday life in the 20s, to the war effort in the 40s, to the civil rights movement in the 60s. Looking at his work was like a positive feedback loop, the more of it I saw the more of it I wanted to see, much the way I feel about New Yorker Cartoons.
      <br><br>
            There is something about two birds with one stone solutions that get me jazzed. And if that happens to be in the public sphere all the better. Municipal golf courses have this issue where it is difficult to provide high quality golf at a low price. Because of this most muni courses are in poor shape so that they can be affordable. Usually you need to join a private club to play on a difficult course in top condition. Houston, however, has found a cheat code. By upgrading their muni into a world class facility designed a by top-5 golf course architect, Tom Doak, they are able to host Houston’s PGA tour event. The event will bring in enough money to subsidize the rest of the year, keeping prices low and quality high. So the Houston residents get the best city golf course in the country for cheap 51 weeks of the year, and get to watch the world’s best compete on their home course the other week. It’s a beautiful solution to a prickly problem muni courses face all over the country. I got to play on Sunday, a sunny 73 degree day in late December, and I have never enjoyed a casual round of golf more. 7,400 yards, strategically designed and beautiful, it was an inspirational model that the PGA tour would do well to repeat.

            I’ve never seen such driving. He must have been drunk. All over the road. Sometimes going 60, other times 95. A tire across one line or another more often than they were within the lane. I gained his acquaintance as I was waiting in the left lane on I-10 for one semi to pass another. He came racing up going 90+ in the right lane. Swerving next to me as he looked at his phone, I fell back, thinking he’d fly by and be gone. Instead he moved into the left lane, pulled level with one of the semi’s and just sat there. Swerving left, then right, he came within inches of colliding with the semi’s tires. It was absolutely terrifying. How many drinks had he had? No one in their right mind would drive like this. I fell even farther back, giving myself enough time to break in case of an accident. About a mile later as I was still trailing, too scared to pass, he swerved so far onto the shoulder on the right that his Mustang’s left tires were bumping over the rivets on the outside of the lane. He wasn’t the only bad driver on this section of I-10 between Houston and New Orleans. There were numerous swerving Samuels obsessed with their phones, a number of cars so oblivious to their speed they would pass me on the left move over into the right lane and slow down enough that I was breaking behind them, but this guy in the white Ford Mustang was on a completely different level. He was a different species. I’ve never seen a driver so incapasitated on the road.
      <br><br>
            I trailed him for almost 10 miles before he took off on one of his 90mph+ charges and I thought he’d lost me. I got back up to cruising speed and the road opened up to three lanes when I saw him crawling at 60 in the right lane. I couldn’t stay behind him any longer, going slower than him now would be very dangerous with most cars on the road moving at 80mph. This was my chance, I was going to pass him. I got into the left lane, giving a lane barrier, and started gaining on him. As I was zooming past him he starts flooring and quickly gets back ahead. Then as he was passing a black Escalade, maybe 15 yards ahead of me, he goes into one of his characteristic swerves and straight into the side of the Escalade. I couldn’t hear the collision, but they were now swerving over leftward into my lane. I slam on the breaks, everything in the car flies forward, the breaks start seizing and chugging. I thought there was no chance, all I could see was the black Escalade in front of me at a 30 degree angle. The new tires paid off immediately! With the old tires I would have been a goner. The extra stopping of the new tires and they came swerving over less than three inches in front of Norman’s front right headlight. Now my eyes flashed to the rearview mirror. I’d been watching this whole thing go down, eyes on the Mustang as I was trying to pass, so my reaction was immediate, but the cars behind might not have been so aware. Looking back there were at least four pairs of swerving headlights. The black SUV behind me was skidding and swerving left towards the barrier. The other three were bearing down on the Mustang and Escalade.
      <br><br>
            My memory completely blacks out at this point, my mind too in the present to bother making memories. I don’t know how many cars piled up, or even how I skirted around and passed the accident. The next thing I remember was putting my left hand out the window thanking the SUV behind me for not crashing into my rear. Then with disbelief I see a white mustang exiting at exit 158 going 100mph!!! Whatt what had I just seen? That looked like the same mustang, and his driving was equally recklous. Had he caused the accident and then fled the scene, fearing the consequences of being drunk?!?
      <br><br>
            I was riled up. Absolute insanity. Somehow I was fine, and Norman was too. I called 911 to report the accident and say I thought I saw the mustang fleeing the scene at exit 158. I think I was the first to report and they said they’d be sending people immediately. I then had to call everyone who would pick up on Christmas Eve and recount the story. Flustered, jacked up, bugging out, hyper alert, I made my way to the parents in Algiers Point, across the river from New Orleans. They had a lovely Christmas Eve meal prepared. My hunger and fortune of arriving safely made the good food taste heavenly. With a searing headache, I called it quits soon afterwards and went to bed.
      <br><br>
            Looking at the reports the next day some of those screeching cars must not have been able to stop; the news stated that “the right and center lanes are blocked on I-10 East at Acadian Thruway due to an accident.”

            We woke up early on the 26th to take a drive up the Mississippi and tour the Whitney and Laura Plantations. Part of the gold coast, the humid, hot, swampy plantations of southern Louisiana were perfect for growing sugar cane. Originally indigo plantations, the sugar cane grew so well, and the growing season was so long in the area, that it became the cash crop.
      <br><br>
            “At its core slavery was an economic institution. It was the economics which made slavery inevitable, it was racism which decided who they did it to. They would have done it to the Native Americans, but they were too susceptible to disease and could flee too easily because they knew the land better than anyone, that they weren’t economic. The Africans were skilled laborers, less susceptible to disease, non-christain, and cheap. The average price for a slave in the gold coast was 1,000. Owners would recoup that investment after five and a half months on the plantation. Believe me, if Africans did not make economic sense, they would have found someone else to work this land. It doesn’t matter if that person was blue. Racism decided who they did it to, and was used to keep the institution in place, but it was all about economics.” explained Ali, our weary eyed tour guide.
      <br><br>
            “The decisions at the plantation were also all economic. The slaves could not learn to read or write because then they might learn what was actually in the text of the bible and they might learn that moss always grows on the north side of the trees. The light skinned blacks were given work in the house and special privileges to separate the unity on the enslaved. Always split up the oppressed and find a way to pit them against one another.”
      <br><br>
            “Slavery has existed as long as there has been war. The victor would take the captured enemies as slaves. It’s how the Egyptians built the pyramids. How the Romans built the colosseum. In Africa there was already a substantial trans-sharan slave trade and the europeans just directed it to the new world. The Eurpoeans traded their goods and guns for the captured slaves of traders and tribes and shipped them to the Americas. They wanted their new lands cultivated and the profits sent back to the motherland.”
      <br><br>
            “For every 100 births there were 113 deaths down here on the gold coast. Up north in Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, where they were growing cotton, the birth rate was positive. So the slave owners would sell their slaves down river, which is where the saying comes from, down here to Louisiana to be worked to death. They would work 16 to 18 hour days in 95 degree heat and 90 percent humidity. Then in mid october, during the grinding season, they would work overlapping 18 hour days. First they would burn the fields because the sugar cane leaves are so sharp they would cut you all over. But that doesn’t hurt the sugar, if anything it makes it a bit sweater because it starts the carmilizing process. Then the slaves would be sent out in formation, wide machetes in hand and harvest. If someone died out there in the heat or in an accident, they didn't have time to stop, they just moved them to the side and kept working.”
      <br><br>
            Ali was an incredible tour guide on the immoral economics of the institution.
      <br><br>
            A lunch of gumbo, catfish, and beans at B&C seafood on the banks of the mississippi before heading to the Laura Plantation. After a morning focused on the institution from the perspective of the salves and how the institution came to be, we got a different perspective at Laura. It was a more holistic tour of life inside the house and out.
      <br><br>
            “The French government hoped to cultivate these lands and used propaganda to convince people to come over. In the advertisements they described Louisiana like it was Switzerland, with tall snow peaked mountains and rolling farmland. On the journey over, more than 70% died, and upon arrival they found the land a impenatable swamp. The travelers that did make it then had to then turn their aligator infested swamp land into productive cropland quickly, as it was their only means of survival.”
      <br><br>
            “As you can see, with its yellow, green, blue, pink, and red, this is not the all white plantation house you think of. This is designed in the Creole style. Those brick columns you see supporting the house actually go down in a triangle eight feet deep and connect with one another to give the building stability. Below them are logs of cedar and sand...The front of the house is facing the Mississippi, because here in Louisiana it is always hot. The cool breezes from the Mississippi would flow through the house and take the hot air with it...As you will see, there are no closets for hallways in the house, because they tend to trap the heat.”
      <br><br>
            “The sister and brother did not like each other at all. So much so that their mother decided to split the plantation in two; the son got the upriver section and the plantation house; and the daughter got the downriver section and the sugar mill. The daughter then refused to let her brother use the mill during harvest, and he had to pay to use a neighbor's mill.”
      <br><br>
            “These slave cabins are not here because of conservation. They are here because people lived in them until 1972. After the civil war life on the plantation did not change all that much. All of their skills revolved around cultivating sugarcane. All they had known their whole life was this plantation. Some may have moved north, but many stayed here and continued farming the land, this time for pay. Sharecropping was common, but on this farm the system was that they got paid in tokens which were redeemable at the company store, which was set up on the plantation. If you needed something from the store, like soap, and didn’t have the tokens you could go into debt to pay for it. At the end of the year you could redeem your tokens for cash. But the prices at the store would be set high, so that farmers would have a deficit of tokens, and be forced to work another season to pay off their debts.”

            New Orleans was a very black and soulful place. The depth of character and vibrancy of life there surpassed that of any other stop on the trip. Music was a part of life, the sound of brass and jazz audible on many street corners. The architecture is colorful and unique; long very thin shotgun homes that were sometimes ornately decorated, with window shutters, and lots of colorful flair. All over town, in all types of neighborhoods, they gave the city a charming old world vibe. The cuisine too is so unique to the region and positively delicious. I couldn’t get enough gumbo, the red beans were sooo rich, and the seafood was so flavorful and fresh. The soulfulness of the place was infectious, and seemed to be within all inhabitants of the city. The jazz clubs we went into had 20 year olds, 80 year olds, and everything in between. In Cambridge my folks would be the dance floor elders, in New Orleans they were middle aged, and were struggling to keep up with the 70 year olds boogieing next to them. It made it all such a vibrant atmosphere because everyone was contributing to the fun of the place. All were welcome, all had a place, the only requirement was that you had a love of life.

            On Saturday, Wayne, a New Orleans native, invited us to join him in a second line parade down ____. We did not know what to expect, all we knew was that there would be people, a band, and it was a walking party. The band was the first line, and all of us walking and dancing along behind formed the second line. Put on by various social clubs or benevolent societies for 40 or so weekends of the year, just because they like to have a rolicking good time. Strutting and swinging and dancing through the streets of New Orleans, 400 people, mostly black, it was as good as life gets. Kids kept jumping in front of the band for their three seconds of dancing fame, female dancers from the Ladies of Class wore pink outfits with feathers and led the first line, and again all ages of life showed up to the party.

            82 days, 10,172 miles, 7 code releases. At the end of a long trip like the one I have been on would seem like the opportune time to reflect back on all that had transpired. What had I learned? What were my favorite moments? Had I changed? However, the most noticeable difference might have been that there was less of me. I was looking slimmer that I had in years. On the southern asphalt, I had grown beyond bored of my car snacks  I could not stomach another nut or piece of dried fruit. I chose a rumbling stomach over the last vestiges of my snacks. More than that though was that all the kettlebelling seemed to be paying off.
      <br><br>
            Originally used to weigh produce in the barter economy of 18th century Russia, these old time farmers started to swing their bells for fitness. It became a national pastime as their benefits became clear. The first kettlebell competition dates back to 1885. Around the turn of the 20th America even got its first taste of kettlebell training. Then in the cold war everything Russia was despised. It wasn’t until the 1990s when a russian transplant Pavel Tsatsouline re-added kettlebells into America's fitness cannon.
      <br><br>
            I got turned onto them by my co-worker Franklin. A bald, beautifully physiqued mathematician, he does two things, kettlebell and talk. His incessant chatter finally convinced me to give it a try. Before, I’d been growing stronger and wider with Starting Strength’s barbell program. With the trip looming I figured kettlebells might be a good way to do fitness on the road. I ain’t no runner and barbells don’t travel so I bought myself a 24kg kettlebell. Then with remarkable diligence considering my disdain for weights, I followed Pavel’s simple and sinister plan while on the road. Consisting of 5 turkish get ups each side, and 10 sets of 10 swings, I started chipping off the fat. 25 minutes max the workout is short enough to force myself to do it, day after day.
      <br><br>
            I’d gotten a belly at some point between my 135lb freshman self and my 175lb post college self. I haven’t gotten on a scale yet but I can just tell this is the fittests I’ve looked in a few years. My one pack is now looking like a three pack. I also feel fit, crushing hikes during the trip with newfound ease. It wasn’t a takeaway I’d imagined from the trip, but not one I am upset about either.

            What is the proper length of a trip? I’d been on a month long trip to India during college, and a two week trip to China a year before, and they’d made me think traveling might not be for me. I felt like travel was such a sensory experience, but it did not have much bite. You tried interesting food, met new people, saw amazing sights, but none of it asked much of you. Days were full, many activites packed into too few days, yet I felt a bit unchallenged. I found myself missing my life back home where I felt like things were building on top of one another; where I had a purpose. It made me wonder how I’d fare with three months. It turned out to be completely different. I loved being on the road. Those empty vistas were restorative. I totally liked sleeping on the couch and catching up with old friends. Exploring the states felt like I was learning something about who I was, what being American meant. I got used to the rhythms of the road and the constant intrigue around every corner that I found myself longing for it during the Thanksgiving break.
      <br><br>
            Now it felt strange to think this great adventure was over. I was in conflict over if I wished the trip to continue. I was happy to be on a flight to see Iz and the housemates. But it did not feel good to be ending the Long One. Even if I did it all over again some other time it would not match the first voyage. There is nothing like the honesty and clarity your eyes see upon first inspection. All details of a place present themselves. Over time, through repetition, your eyes adjust, refining the data which it notices, giving you only the essentials. Also, did this mean I was middle aged? It was an odd and discomforting thought. Would I keep looking back to these months longing for that sense of freedom and exploration? I didn’t currently have the desire to keep going. Another hike didn’t sound that exciting. What was another museum going to offer? That giddiness for the next stop, which had accompanied much of the trip, was no longer felt. I think that meant the timing was right, but six years from now I wonder how much I would be willing to give up to do a couple more months.
